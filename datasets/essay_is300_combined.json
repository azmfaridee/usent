    "Q3": "Mark Makris\nApr 3, 2017\nIS 300, Section 3\nCyber Essay 1\n\t“A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources” (“Digital Attack Map”, 2013). This is just a way for people to stop everyone from using a service, which is why it is often targeted at businesses that provide a service like Xbox live or the Playstation network. For some reason someone thought it would be great if they could prevent everybody from using their video game consoles online on Christmas and for a few days after a few years ago. Some other companies that might be high targets could be banks, online market places, or other businesses that use the internet to conduct business, but the larger the network the more difficult it is to attack. The reason larger networks are more difficult to take down is because DDoS attacks use networks of people’s computers without permission and the more computers they need to take down a network the longer and more challenging it will be to gain access to the required number of computers. Hackers can use lots of methods to remotely control other people’s computers through email or websites which is another reason to have good anti malware on every computer. This is a very basic but effective attack that can come in a variety of forms that all target one portion of the network process and just try to overwhelm it. They can try to overwhelm all available connections to infrastructures, consume all the bandwidth, flood the packet re-assembler, or maybe even one specific application. Although there are ways to combat these attacks because just like anything else they are not perfect. To best combat DDoS attacks companies want to prevent them from happening in the first place. One way to prevent attacks is to have more bandwidth than the company really needs so that it is more difficult to overwhelm the large network even with all the people actually using it normally. If a company is not large enough to be able to afford the cost of having lots of bandwidth they can use applications that track traffic to set up a baseline and if it goes to high above the baseline find and clean out the traffic that is being used to attack. Then there are very complex systems put into place within networks and applications that can make them more resilient to these types of attacks. This is not the type of attack that you find and destroy once it attacks like a Trojan or logic bomb, it is something that is always happening and just has to be mitigated or prevented. There I not much a company can do once their network goes down other than improve their network.\nCitation\nDigital Attack Map. (2013).

    "Q3": "Have you ever received an email, text, or pop-up message that ask for your personal or financial information? Chances are you have experienced phishing. Phishing scams are typically fraudulent email messages appearing to come from legitimate enterprises (e.g., your university, your internet service provider, your bank). These messages usually direct you to a spoofed website or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft (Levine, 2015). \nPhishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as \"spear phishing\". Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success (Lord, 2017). The term \"whaling\" is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization (Levine, 2015). Within a 2 month span in the beginning of 2016, at least 55 companies had announced that they had fallen victim to a highly tailored spear phishing scheme. This scheme is responsible for stealing and compromising the W-2 U.S. tax records of every employee working for these companies during 2015. Any company that collects tax records of their employees can fall victim to spear phishing. After the malicious individuals stole the W-2 records, they then sold the information off underground. Then, Silk Road-like forums are sent to a number of different small operators who will file fraudulent tax returns in the name of the victims (Landesman, 2016). The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone (Lord, 2017). \t\nThe best way you can protect yourself from phony phishers is to understand what legitimate financial service providers and respectable online auction houses will and will not do. Most importantly, legitimate entities will not ask you to provide or verify sensitive information through a non-secure means, such as email. A few key examples of ways to combat and protect yourself/ business from phishing are: calling the company to verify they are the ones who sent the email. Also, rather than merely clicking on the link provided in the email, type the URL into your web browser yourself. This way you can see if the link is in fact, a fake. Personal firewalls and security software packages (with anti-virus, anti-spam, and spyware detection features) are also a must-have for those who engage in online financial transactions. Make sure your computer has the latest security patches, and make sure that you conduct your financial transactions only on a secure web page using encryption. You can tell if a page is secure in a couple of ways. Look for a closed padlock in the status bar, and see that the URL starts with “https” instead of just “http.” Finally, you can find more information of the attacker by searching for the Anti-Phishing Working Group to get more information on the sharks out there (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2015). Malicious individuals use phishing as a way to fool civilians and bypass companies to gain private information for identity fraud. It is important not only for companies, but for individuals themselves to be educated on cyber-attacks to protect their own information. \nWorks Cited\nLandesman, T.

Since phishing attacks can choose targets and see their computers, all companies can be part of a phishing attack. For example, these attacks can steal data or misused system devices/equipment intruded upon or damaged. There are incidents of phishing attacks such as tax fraud, brand fraud, and consumer fraud countermeasures.

    "Q3": "Computers have become an integral part of almost every facet of everyday life. As organizations and governments employ more resources and new methods to defend these systems, the methods of such attacks grow ever more complex. One example is a Botnet, defined as “a collection of compromised computers that are remotely controlled by a Botmaster, through a Command and Control (C&C) entity” (Azab, Alazab, Aiash, 2004, pg 1788). In essence, otherwise uninvolved computers because unwitting slaves to an adversary, who then uses them to carry out various attacks, such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, but also for sending spam, phishing, and so forth. While such attacks can be executed in any number of ways, a botnet is unique in that it employs a system for command and control of the compromised computers; a way for the attacker to command their slave “army”.\n\nAny company that relies on the internet to conduct business is at risk. The Zeus toolkit, for example, is focused on banks and financial institutions; and was reportedly responsible for 80% of total attacks in 2011 (Azab, et al., 2004). However, there are many kinds of botnets, and more are being created. The new Mirai botnet, first detected in 2016, used thousands of “zombie” devices to attack everything from single journalists to entire ISP providers both in the US and abroad (Newman, 2016). The Russian-made Bredolab botnet was another significant attack, distributing malware and email spam.\n\nBecause of the number of ways a botnet can be used to attack, there is no one single way to defend against them. In the case of a DDoS attack, where zombie computers work together to bog down a target in spammed information requests, the key is to create a system for identifying infected computers and ignoring their requests, while still letting through legitimate ones. Machine learning can be useful in this regard (Azab, et al., 2004). To prevent a computer from being compromised and used as a botnet zombie, it is crucial to maintain an up-to-date anti-virus software with regular scans for malicious software. Even if a company is not coming under attack by a botnet, it may have computers which are being slaved for a botnet attack on someone else.\n\n\n\nAzab, A., Alazab, A., Aiash, M. (2016).

    "Q3": "Cyber Essay: Distributed Denial of Service Attacks\n     DDOS or Distributed denial of service attacks are a frequent phenomenon in the current cyberspace. Botnets, large amounts of infected computers, send millions of false packets to commit the attack. DDOS attacks cause the entire server to be flooded with false packets and junk data that slows and cripples the network infrastructure of the server. The result is a catastrophic failure impacting hardware and creating revenue loss.\n      DDOS attacks can happen to any large structure network such as Google, Facebook Microsoft, and Sony. They can also attack smaller sites to silence unpopular media; recently a video game critic know as Jim Sterling had his site as attacked after he released and unpopular review of a favorite videogame franchise. Attacks can happen to anyone and it is the cooperation’s job to protect their assets.\n       Protection from distributed denial of service attacks is expensive, however, there are a great many technologies from firewalls to filters to sort these bad packets. Companies such as Cloud Flare offer a wide variety of resources to combat this issue of attacks. They impellent enough overhead read room to process the junk data therefore not effecting the cooperation’s infrastructure.  Microsoft uses a version of their current Azure architecture firewall to thwart these attacks. Bharathidasan University in Tiruchirappalli, India is developing a software that can “detect DDOS attacks or effectively using a threshold technique.” It’s a technique that measures the amount of traffic coming to the server and setting a “threshold” or a max limit of users. This max limit is far more than the amount of average traffic that is sent through. The software developed helps the industry foresee the attack before it has happened. There are many solutions to these attacks that companies can implement that are economical and easy.  \n         \n                                                       Citation\nManimaran, A., & Durairaj, M.

    "Q3": "My topic is Logic Bomb. The logic bomb is also known as a “slag code”, which is a programming code that is inserted into a software, operating system, or application secretly. It will only activate when specific condition is met, such as a specific time, event, or when the application is launched. Otherwise, the programming code will stay dormant until one of those specification is met. The attack is usually malicious and almost always intentional. The purpose of the logic bomb is to reformat a hard drive by deleting, altering, or corrupting the data. Everyone is a target for this type of attack (What is a Logic Bomb). The most targeted type of organization is the government and other government contractors. We know the most important information about the country and their defense system is being hold in secret by the government. There is always someone wanting to get their hands on the information for their benefits whether it is for money, exploitation, or trying to invade the country. If the logic bomb attack is successful in infiltrating the government system they can corrupted, altered, or deleted sensitive information, it would be very damaging to the country and put the country in an incredibly vulnerable state. An example, in 2013 South Korea was attacked with logic bomb. It wiped out hard drives at banks and broadcasting companies (Storm, 2015). This attack is only on a small scale. Another example is in October 2003 a man named Yung-Hsun Lin inserted a logic bomb into Medco’s IT where he is working at the time because he feared of losing his job. After it failed to activated on April 23, 2004 due to an error in the code. He corrected the code and change the activation date to April 23, 2005. His logic bomb was detected because another Medco systems administrator was doing maintenance the system and found the code within the systems scripts. He later got a 97 months conviction for his logic bomb (Weiss, 2006). If it were to attack air traffic controllers, disable country defense system, open dams, etc., it could lead to many people in injures and the country in harm. The way to combat the attack is constantly scanning your computer, installing and updating anti-virus software. It is one of the best ways to combat against this type of attack, but it is not total protection.\n\n\nCitation\nStorm, D. (2015, November 25).

    "Q3": "The type of attack I have chosen to discuss is Phishing. Phishing is an attempt to solicit personal information from the user by employing several social engineering techniques (Report Phishing Sites, n.d.). Phishing typically involves sending a direct email that appears to be sent from a legitimate organization to the user by asking a series of questions or statements that lure them into clicking a link to a website, that will steal precious information from the user when asked to input personal information such as passwords. In addition, the websites often contain malicious code. Any business or organization can become a victim to phishing as long as it involves any finance-based scheme. Customers that do business with that organization are targeted as well. In many instances, scammers are able to phish to gain access to W2 information. One example would be Seagate, a technology powerhouse. Someone posing as an employee successfully requested W2 information for all data for current and former employees with their attack (Ragan, 2016). In another instance, for Magnolia Health Corporation, a person posing as the CEO was sent an Excel spreadsheet that contained sensitive information about the employees. In both cases, the companies were victims to having their data compromised. Most of the time, the goal for the incidents appeared to be for tax fraud. There are many ways to combat against these attacks. The user should not click any links or attachments from emails asking to update or verify user details, conduct an internet search of exact wording of the email for reference to the scam, look for the secure symbol on the browser window, and never provide personal, credit card information or online account details if receiving a call claiming to be from a bank or other business, but should check with the organization to confirm (Phishing, 2016). Having awareness of the signs of Phishing will potentially keep sensitive information from being compromised.\n\n\nCitation\n\nPhishing. (2015, September 21).

    "Q3": "Christopher Boyer\nIS 300\nCyber Attack Essay\nApril 2, 2017\n\nBlack Hole Cyber Attacks\n\n\tIn the ever-increasing technological world, our society has become accustomed to experiencing cyber threats on a large scale every single day. One such attack that has gained traction recently and has become a major threat to companies and individuals alike is the “Black Hole Cyber Attack”. A Black Hole is created when a hacker creates a scenario where all data coming into a router is lost when it reaches the network. The name comes from how a Black Hole in space brings in anything that reaches its gravitational pull and makes it disappear in its immense gravity. The user may be completely unaware that their data did not reach its destination and they would not know unless they tracked their transmissions to see where they failed.\n\tBlack Holes in the cyber world can occur naturally, in instances where the host is offline, the data does not reach the recipient and this is nearly identical to a Black Hole attack. One interesting feature of Black Hole cyber-attacks is that they are invisible, one must trace network traffic to find that the transmissions do not make it to the recipient to identify that the Black Hole is present. Black Hole cyber-attacks are so efficient they may see “above 10% infection rates for an entire campaign”, per Rod Rasmussen with SecurityWeek. The Black Hole hacking software are created by teams of hackers who write the programs and maintain their effectiveness. These teams then sell the programs to anyone willing to pay the price for them. Since creating these programs and not using them for any nefarious purposes is not a crime in and of itself, the teams in charge of designing and maintaining this malicious software are rarely brought to justice. One such individual known by the online alias “Paunch” operated out of Moscow and was well known throughout the community and had not faced any legal repercussions until late 2013 when he was arrested for his efforts. Once he was apprehended, Black Hole attacks had not been nearly as widely used until much more recently.\n\tTargets for Black Hole attacks could be any online organization with a high volume of customer traffic. Companies that issue broad statements over email or social media are especially at risk because those who orchestrate the attacks will send messages using the template normally used by the organization. They may also use very similar email addresses to fool users into following the link. If these hackers sign up for an organization’s emailing service and receive any email they can easily download and manipulate the template to suit their needs. According to SecurityWeek, these hacks, once implemented are initiated using phishing techniques, sending out warnings that seem to be from major financial institutions about “inappropriate behaviors or mysterious charges”. \n\tBlack Hole cyber-attacks have already been used to target major institutions including American Express, AT&T, and Verizon. One such attack was orchestrated on the giant professional social media company, LinkedIn. In 2011, the company seemingly distributed a series of professional connection emails that were actually links to trick the users into falling into their traps. When an attempt at a professional connection is made, the service sends an email with a link button that would say “Confirm that you know ____ (user name)”. If the fake link was clicked, the link would take the user to a website that would download malware onto their computer. This malware is known as the “Zeus 2 malware”, per Boodaei with Security Intelligence. This would then target the service’s networks to steal information and allow the hackers access to secure systems. The targets of this attack were both user trying to access the site and LinkedIn. \n\tAlthough Black Hole attacks quieted down following the apprehension of “Paunch”, increasing numbers of incidences have occurred recently due to the program’s source code having leaked and was made public. Most up to date systems are safe from these attacks now that the masterminds behind the attacks are no longer in play, but users and corporations alike should beware because outdated computers and networking systems can still be at risk for the malicious attacks. \n\nCitations:\n\nRasmussen, R.

Specifically, multiple infected computers attack a certain server or website. This can effect a huge range of businesses because most have a website that you can go through or a server base, which means not many are safe from this attack. Sony has had many DDoS attacks over the past few years, the most damaging one being in 2011 when Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) was DDoS'd and a reported 77 million users personal details were accessed.

    "Q3": "Phishing, in the cyber security sense, is the act of maliciously collecting private information such as credit card accounts, passwords, and bank information, by disguising as a legitimate organization. This can often be done by email, where sometimes a URL link, seemingly coming from a trustworthy place, like one’s bank, is embedded in an email. Without knowing better, the user enters his or her passwords at the website’s prompts, giving the attacker valuable information. Phishing attacks have become very sophisticated, sometimes copying the logo of the businesses they are trying to impersonate. Unless one knows what to look for, it can be easy to fall into their trap. \nIndividuals as well as business are targets for phishing scams. Many times a business will be targeted, and the business’ systems are held in limbo unless a ransom is paid (this is called ransom ware). By December 2013, Cryptolocker ransom ware infected 250,000 personal computers by first targeting businesses using a Zip archive attachment that claimed to be a customer complaint and later targeting general public using a link in an email regarding a problem clearing a check. This type of software encrypts a computer’s information unless a sum of money is paid. \nThe most effective way to combat phishing scams is education. Business and individuals can educate themselves about how to spot fake and malicious content. Browsers and email servers are also becoming more efficient at recognizing attacks. Many popular web browsers such as firefox and internet explorer have warnings that show up when they detect a suspicious webpage, alerting the user to a potential threat. Many organizations are changing the way they contact customers, addressing them by username, instead of a generic “Dear valued customer.” All these initiatives are aimed at mitigating the threat posed by phishing scams.\n\n\nMossberg, W.

These hidden features may then be used to gain control of the computer system and access important database. These types of attack are called logic bomb attacks. Logic bomb attacks could pose great risk to the security and integrity of an organization. Most companies in today’s world use apps in order to make services to their customer more convenient and mobile. Businesses and corporations like banks, supermarket stores, Stock broker, or any other organization which use a computer software or app to perform daily tasks or connect to their customers can easily become a victim of a logic bomb attack. \n\nCyber-attacks like logic bomb attacks can hurt the company’s reputation, which could end up in some big loss for the company. Android is one of the most popular mobile operating system today and is also one of the heavily targeted OS by malware. Per the article about detecting logic bombs in Android applications, android till this day has been fighting against malware apps in the google play store. Android users have experienced location service problems where the user turns off the location service but the application keeps the location service on and sends location information to the developer of the app without the user’s knowledge. Another problem Android has faced is with their SMS app, where users are receiving texts from companies they have not even subscribed to nor visited. Android has implemented a prototype called TriggerScope which analyzes apps in the operating system to search for the codes or algorithms which might not be placed by the original developer.\nAnyone can become a victim of logic bomb attacks but there are ways to lower your chances of being hurt by these attacks by following certain precautions. Most of the software that are undocumented are distributed on pirated websites, so avoiding visit to pirated website could help lower the risk of an attack.

    "Q3": "Mark Minnis\nIS 300, Section 3\nCyber Assignment 1\n4/3/17\n\n\tFor this assignment I chose to research a Man in the Middle attack. This type of attack or hack occurs when communication between two users is being monitored by an unauthorized third party. This attack is carried out when an unauthorized third party intercepts a public key message exchange. Once they have this public key they are to replace it with one of their own so that all communication now goes through this third party. Once this has been put in place the original two users continue to communicate normally with no idea that they are actually in communication with this unauthorized third party. Hackers are able to carry out these attacks by taking advantage of weaknesses that they identify in network connections. Once they have gained access to these networks they are interpreting messages between the two original users, however the two original parties have no idea so they continue to communicate normally. One type of business that can fall victim to these attacks are banks and other finical businesses. For example, “if you are banking online, the man in the middle would communicate with you by impersonating your bank, and communicate with the bank by impersonating you” (Sullivan, 2017). A recent example of a Man in the Middle occurred in Europe where 49 individuals were arrested under the suspicion of using this style of hacking to intercept payment requests that were sent over emails. There are a few different ways in which you can combat these attacks. For example you can set up an intrusion detective system or IDS, which can monitor your network and send you an alert if someone is trying to hack into it. Another way you can combat these attacks is to use a virtual private network or VPN, which can add additional secure layers whenever you are trying to access a certain network or are working with confidential information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\nHidayatullah, S.

DDoS which is short for a distributed denial-of-service attack, is a type of attack that sends large amounts of data to a specified network connection to essentially overload and shut down the service whether temporary or permanent. Mostly businesses/corporations are victims of these types of attacks, and seldom individuals are targeted as well. The reasoning for these types of attacks is simply to cause chaos and cause digital vandalism. In fact in sometime in October 2016 there was a massive DDoS attack on Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Reddit, and some other websites that shut down their servers for over 11 hours. The big ways to prevent such attacks from happening would be having some sort of anti-virus software and firewalls up. For larger corporations with money, updating hardware and creating better coding for server protection would some of the main means of DDoS protection.\nCitation\nBlumenthal, E. & Weise, E.

    "Q3": "A DDOS attack (AKA Distributed Denial of Service) is a type of cyber attack that aims to make a service unavailable by throttling their servers by sending mass amounts of traffic. There are four common attacks: TCP connection attacks, Volumetric attacks, Fragmentation attacks, and Application attacks. TCP connection attacks try to use up all the connections for things like firewalls or application servers. Volumetric is the one people most understand a DDOS attack to be. These attacks try to consume as much bandwidth as possible to cause massive congestion. Fragmentation attacks send TCP or UDP fragments to reduce performance by severing streams. Application attacks just focus on certain features of an application and try to overload it, these are harder to detect as it takes way less traffic to cause damage. DDOS attacks usually target banks or news websites as a means to silence an organization or disrupt their online presence. A recent example of this is the DDOS attack on BBC news website by hacker group New World Hacking. “One possible reason to conduct a DDoS attack against a high-profile target such as the BBC or Donald Trump is marketing, said A10 Networks' Nicholson.” DDOS hackers do so a lot of the time to showcase their botnets capability. Botnets are a network of infected computers that can be controlled remotely without the owner knowing they are apart of this botnet. These infected computers are what cause the major traffic as botnets can be as huge as millions of computers big. Another example of a DDOS attack in action was the 2014 Lizard Squad Christmas attack that brought down PSN and Xbox Live. This caused much outrage as people couldn’t use the new product they bought for the holidays as both needed an internet patch in order to work properly. One of the easiest ways to protect yourself from a DDOS attack is to buy more bandwidth than you actually need. More bandwidth becomes cheaper the bigger your company is. Another way is to have automate mitigation tools which sets a baseline and monitors traffic. If traffic goes off this baseline they send this noisy traffic to some mechanism and send the clean traffic through the network.\n\n\tCitation\n\nKorolov, M. (2016, January 8).

These hidden features may then be used to gain control of the computer system and access important database. These types of attack are called logic bomb attacks. Logic bomb attacks could pose great risk to the security and integrity of an organization. Most companies in today’s world use apps in order to make services to their customer more convenient and mobile. Businesses and corporations like banks, supermarket stores, Stock broker, or any other organization which use a computer software or app to perform daily tasks or connect to their customers can easily become a victim of a logic bomb attack. \n\n       Cyber-attacks like logic bomb attacks can hurt the company’s reputation, which could end up in some big loss for the company. Android is one of the most popular mobile operating system today and is also one of the heavily targeted OS by malware. Per the article about detecting logic bombs in Android applications, android till this day has been fighting against malware apps in the google play store. Android users have experienced location service problems where the user turns off the location service but the application keeps the location service on and sends location information to the developer of the app without the user’s knowledge. Another problem Android has faced is with their SMS app, where users are receiving texts from companies they have not even subscribed to nor visited. Android has implemented a prototype called TriggerScope which analyzes apps in the operating system to search for the codes or algorithms which might not be placed by the original developer.\n\n      Anyone can become a victim of logic bomb attacks but there are ways to lower your chances of being hurt by these attacks by following certain precautions. Most of the software that are undocumented are distributed on pirated websites, so avoiding visit to pirated website could help lower the risk of an attack.

    "Q3": "A logic bomb is a type of malware that is triggered by an event or time. A logic bomb can be put on a computer by sneaking it in through a trojan horse, or embedding it in code of an application. Cyber-criminals can use a logic bomb to activate keylogger on certain websites to steal credentials that are input to the site. All businesses and individuals should be fearful of logic bombs, because it can be used for identity theft leaving both the business and the individuals vulnerable. One example of a logic bomb being used is, 2006 when a system administrator of Union Bank of Switzerland planted a logic bomb in an attempt to drop the USB stock price. Another example is in 2008 when a logic bomb was used in an attempt to wipe server data, and had it been successful, 4000 servers would have been wiped. Many logic bombs are planted by people on the inside of the company. In order to prevent logic bombs from being used against your company or you as an individual, limit the number of people with full access to the website and servers, hire the right people, and treat those people right. In order to protect yourself from someone trying to plant a logic bomb, you can use network surveillance and monitoring programs. Also, implementing software development policies and procedures can make planting logic bombs more difficult for someone. \n\n\nHaber, M. (2010, May 20). Worried about logic bombs? you should be.

Password attacks are attacks that are used to gain a user's password and overall gain control of computer system or network. A more commonly known type of a password attack are trojan horses. Trojan horses are computer programs that take unseen and malicious actions behind the scenes that take the user's username and password without them knowing. Password attacks can occur to any companies since the attacks are dependent on the information the intruders are looking for. For example, if the intruders are looking for bank account passwords they would try to attack bank employee computer or a bank's network.\nA real example of a password attack was when the computers and servers of the Japanese parliament became infected by a Trojan horse virus after one politician opened an email attachment. The best way of defending from password attacks is eternal vigilance. Have the users be more aware of the dangers of writing down passwords, giving it out, or storing it in a file. Also by enforcing and password policy that requires constant changing of passwords, including numbers and capital letters in the passwords. \n\nPassword Attack Methods And Prevention | Secure Passcode Generators.

Phishing attacks are one of the most common security challenges that both\n\nindividuals and companies face in keeping information secure, since it can be applied to a myriad of \n\nbusinesses and individuals (Matthews).

    "Q3": "A distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, works by flooding a network or server with traffic from a network of infected computers otherwise known as a botnet. This flood of traffic overloads the servers until they can no longer function at all. Since the server is flooded with so many requests, it becomes unable to process them all and fails. DDoS attacks can be performed by pretty much anyone, whether through one’s own botnet or a purchased one. The target of these attacks aren’t limited to major networks either, a DDoS attack can be especially crippling to smaller servers that aren’t used to handling large amounts of traffic and can fall much quicker. Attacks could range from a relatively small botnet taking down a tiny website run by a local teenager voicing his opinions to a massive botnet attacking a server and downing much of the United States’ internet such as what happened in October 2016. In October, Dyn was attacked by the Mirai botnet, a botnet consisting of over 100,000 internet-connected devices such as digital cameras and DVD players. The reported attack strength was 1.2TB/s which makes it the most powerful DDoS attack on record nearly two-fold. As for prevention, it’s almost impossible to avoid being the target of a DDoS attack; however, it is easy to avoid being a part of the botnet causing the attack. One must simply maintain proper maintenance on their computer with anti-virus software and a firewall that restricts traffic through your computer. Additionally, one should take care when it comes to distributing their email address to lower the risk of potentially malicious software adding you to a botnet.\n\nSources Cited:\nMcDowell, M.

    "Q3": "Many people store critical information on websites and trust that their password will protect their information so that others cannot access their valued information. However, hackers are able to identify passwords by repeatedly comparing the encrypted data saved to a server to a series of possible passwords until a match is found. This type of password attack is called a brute force attack because of the way a hacker continues to generate many passwords to force their way into an account. This type of attack can affect any business that stores customer passwords or businesses that store sensitive data on a password protected account. Accounts storing critical information such as bank accounts or classified government accounts are at the highest risk for password attacks, but are also often equipped with increased security measures. Just a few years ago, Ashley Madison, a dating website to facilitate cheating, had the usernames and passwords of a third of its users stolen by a group of hackers called The Impact Team. Before the attack, the website believed the data was uncrackable due to the way it was scrambled. The Impact Team decided not to release the 30,000 passwords the team obtained, but instead released the steps they took in order to decode the encrypted passwords to encourage others to use their blueprint. The hacking team also cited they wanted to “protect the end user”, saving thousands from the devastating consequences often resulting from password attacks.\n\nSources\nn.a. (2015, September 11).

    "Q3": "SQL Injection\n \n            In this age of technology, it is found that the more information one could have, the more knowledgeable one could be. This implies that, the more one knows about many different concepts or subjects, the more one can make better decisions towards one's goal. In addition to that, the more one make better decision, the more one would become successful, and the more successful one can be the more powerful one would become. These concepts could be applied in many different aspects of our lives, either in business, government, education, or in other areas. Technology has become parts of our lives that some people are very good at manipulating it for their own interests and benefits. This is where it gets dangerous when one would use technology as a way to harm businesses, institutions, banks or even a whole nation. This leads to the concept of cyber-attack where computer experts such as hackers can intrude, destroy, or harm anything they want from one's personal computer to big businesses or government computer systems. As an example of an attack that is going to be discussed here is the concept of SQL Injection, what is it? Which entity is the most targeted by it? How to prevent it? Those questions would be explored, illustrated by some examples of occurrences that had happened related to SQL Injection.\n \n            In 2011, a mass of an SQL Injection assault called LIZAMOON had occurred, it impacted over a millions of websites. This incident was due to the redirection of an infected user's website. The infection was mainly due to a download of a fake antivirus and a fake malware. You might wonder what SQL Injection is? According to UptalUpadhyay who works in the IT systems and Network Security at the GTU PG School Ahmedabad in India and GirishKhilari who is a Director of Operations Omnipresent Pune in India also. They described that:\" SQL Injection attack is a coding method which can exploit websites databases, where SQL Injection attacks can lead servers and websites to defeat. Using these attacks many sensible information can be exposed.\" In addition to that, according to four researchers from China Jun Liu, Xiaoming Liu, Bo Zheng, J Tang, they described that: \"SQL Injection is one of the techniques which the attacker can use to obtain information from a website, such as account and password information.” The SQL Injection can be issued in many different types such as Tautology, Illegal/Logical queries, Union query, Piggy-backed queries, Stored procedure, Inference, Blind Injection, Timing attacks, and Alternate Encoding. As many industries and organization, taking risks had been a part of their successes due to good investment. However, any industries or organizations using websites, networks could have security breach or face risks under the SQL Injections attack because it is mainly targeting websites. A good thing to notice though, SQL Injection can harm not only SQL server but it can hurt either Java applications or PHP applications As illustrations of the SQL Injections accident for example happened in 2008, where the Heartland payment's system was hacked exposing 134 million credit cards and debit cards. Another example is, in 2011 Sony's Website called Sony BMG Greece was hacked, and after investigation it was found that the hackers used an automated SQL Injection tool to attack the site in order to see if Sony's website had any flaws. Moreover, as many issues that might occurred SQL Injection can be prevented, according to the Berkeley Information Security and Policy, SQL Injection susceptibility can be solved by using parameterized database queries with bound, typed parameters and careful use of parameterized stored procedure in the database. Furthermore, the prevention of SQL Injection could be solved in many different ways but here are just few useful approach to consider. For instance the use of, HP Scrawlr which traces one's website if it is affected by an SQL Injection by crawling the website to evaluate any vulnerabilities. Another instance is the use of URL Scan which consist of restricting the http categories site that Microsoft IIS had fixed.\n \n            To conclude, even though that SQL Injection is considered an old way of hacking, it is important to note that, its potential should not be neglected. Websites are one of the most useful tool for companies either to advertise, or apply any transaction, or to hold customer's account, it is crucial if it is safe and are not vulnerable to any threats. Tests and trials can be applied multiple times in many different ways in order to figure out one’s website flaws. Thus it is important that websites are design in a very well build manner not only against SQL Injection but against any type of threats.\n \n \n \n \n \nCitations\nBerkeley Information Security and Policy.

When someone preforms a DDoS they are usually trying to deny the person or business traffic or even the ability to use the internet. That's because a DDoS typically tries to flood your network so that everything slows to a crawl and legitimate traffic can't get threw. These attacks are a threat to every business, especially those with a website or any means of taking in information from outside sources. \nWhen Blizzard Entertainment launched their newset game Overwatch they became under attack by DDoS bring there launch servers down restricting players from playing the game. This was a major setback for the release for this game, for all the players have to be connected an using a server to play the game. Which was impossible after during the DDoS. While Blizzard never specifically told everyone how they warded off the DDoS attack it can be assumed they used methods such as rate-limiting through routers or switches using Access control list capabilities. The problem with DDoS attacks is that they usually overload you with legitimate content but bad intent. Making it all the more difficult to discern bad traffic from good traffic.\n\nBibliography\nMcDowell, Mindi. (2009, November 4). Understanding denial-of-service attacks.

    "Q3": "Shawn Chowdhry\nIS300\nTypes of Cyber Attacks - SQL injection\n\n\n\tAmong the many various methods that some individual up to no good can use to compromise a website’s data is an SQL Injection. “SQL” refers to “Structured Query Language” - referring to a bunch of various languages developed by different companies to manage their own proprietary software. In most cases, however, the basic commands are the same, with more specialized commands and functions included in the versions of SQL that use them. An SQL injection refers to an attacker using flaws in the programming of some website that interacts with a database to either provide information that should not be public or gain access to parts of the database one normally could not access without proper authorization. \n\t\n\tIn order for an SQL injection to occur, the website or app must make use of an “SQL Query” - that is, the app must ask for some information to be returned from a database. Lots of businesses have need of such an action. Your bank, for example, will use a login app to return your account balance and details. Pretty much any website that stores a database that contains user account information will use an SQL query -- including those as innocuous as web forums, ranging to various e-commerce sites (such as Amazon or eBay) that store your details such as payment and personal information, to business that handle serious financial information (think of your bank, or an investment firm).  They may use various flavors of an SQL language -- but as stated earlier, the basic commands are the same. This is why an SQL injection is such a dangerous attack to suffer: it can affect almost any business. \n\t\n\tIn order to perform an SQL injection, the attacker attempts to use a website or an application on a website in order to ask a database that the company owns, for information. If the database has vulnerabilities, then the attacker could potentially exploit them. For example, the attacker could use an improper input in order to see how the application responds - and if it doesn’t appear to be particularly secure, they can use their knowledge of the programming language to their advantage. Essentially, they trick the application into accepting their input (such as a user name, account name) as a command for the database to execute. In this way, attackers can access data and perhaps even alter or delete it. \n\n\tMajor examples of SQL injections can be found pretty easily: Codecurmudgeon.com lists a “hall of shame” - listing 10 major attacks in 2017 alone - some of which lead to thousands of users worth of account data being leaked. Their list also includes important agencies such as various voting commissions, universities, and even the Department of Defense. Other major SQL injection attacks include the one that lead to the release of the Panama Papers in 2015 -- a major leak of various wealthy people’s financial data, as well as an attacks on the Philippines Commissions on Electronics (releasing 55 million voters’ personal information) and the Qatar National Bank. SQL injections are a very versatile method of attack - almost every website or major institution will maintain databases, and flaws within their code structure could result in serious breaches of their security. \n\n\tThe easiest and most effect way to combat SQL injections is to have the developers in charge of maintaining your databases double check their code for vulnerabilities. Something as simple as ensuring that someone querying the database for an account number can only provide a number to be searched for (rather than a range of numbers) can prevent SQL injections. Through solid coding standards, that are evaluated and tested frequently, most SQL vulnerabilities can be avoided. In addition, ensuring that the application that sends the query from the user has as little access as possible can help mitigate the seriousness in case an injection occurs. If you can only get a certain account number or balance through an injection, that’s only one account compromised. But if that application can query multiple accounts, the possibility of much data being leaked rises drastically. \n\n\tAn SQL injection is a dangerous vulnerability that can affect almost any type of business or company. They’re almost entirely reliant on developer or company mistakes, but they remain a common vulnerability for attackers to exploit. Vigilant standards and careful review of security, however, can minimize the threat that they pose.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\nZorabedian, J. (2016, November 22).

Although there are a multitude of cyber attacks, one type is phishing. Phishing is when a malicious entity uses email or other malicious websites in order to obtain personal  information from a company or individual by posing as a legitimate organization or individual. Attackers that use phishing as a method usually use email as a source to induce individuals to reveal their information. Nowadays everything is done online. There are online banking systems, online payment methods, and many people even shop online. With an increase in online activity, individuals may fall victim to this cyber attack. Also, malicious individuals have a facile way of posing as organizations to obtain personal information from individuals.\n\n         Phishing works in a variety of ways; however, the most common method is using emails to induce individuals to reveal their information. According to the article, some ways the emails may be used include, using a link which may send the individual to a malicious website where it will ask the individual to reveal his/her information. Another way to use an email as a phishing attack would be that the malicious individual will pose as an organization/individual that the victim uses/knows and ask for personal information through the email itself. Also, emails from reputable organizations, such as banks, may be phishing attacks. According to Bill Everhart, many banks do not use emails, so they constantly tell their clients not to trust any emails that are sent from the bank asking for their account information. Any business that relies on personal information, sensitive data, and heavily relies on user logins would most likely come under a phishing attack. An example would be the IRS or a bank. These businesses heavily rely on personal information from their clients, which could be maliciously captured by a phishing attack (Lord, 2017). \n\n         Although there isn’t a clear cut way of combating phishing attacks, individuals could avoid falling victim to these attacks by looking out for the malicious methods used to conduct a phishing attack. According to the article, Ways to combat phishing rely heavily on individuals distinguishing suspicious emails from legitimate emails. Some suspicious emails may include generic greetings, requests for personal information, requests for an urgent response, and spoofed links (Lord, 2017). Since most phishing attacks are initiated through email communication it essential for individuals and companies to watch out for these suspicious emails. Instead of clicking a link or replying with personal information, it would be beneficial to call the source and ask about the email. For example, if an individual received an email from their “business supervisor” asking for sensitive data through an email, the recipient should ask the legitimate business supervisor before replying through the email. \n\n         In conclusion, phishing is a cyber attack method used by malicious individuals to obtain personal and sensitive information mostly through the use of emails. An effective method to combat this cyber attack would be to avoid suspicious emails and use resources to make sure the emails are legitimate. As technology increases, phishing may possibly evolve to become even more harmful and effective, so it is necessary to have methods to combat this cyber attack. \n\n                                                                  Citation\nLord, N.

They target a wide variety of important resources, from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information. The idea of a DDoS attack is for the attacker to generate more traffic than the receiving site can deal with which in turn causes the site or network to go down due to the network being overwhelmed. This is done through the use of multiple computers infected with malicious software being connected to a control server to be remotely controlled, and then the attacker issues the command for the computers to send multiple network requests to the site being attacked. Some recent DDoS attacks were when the group Lizard Squad used DDoS attacks to shut down the Xbox Live server on Christmas Day causing no online gameplay for a couple days, as well as the group New World Order performing a DDos attack on BBC news reaching a record 602Gbps shutting down the site for a few hours on New Year’s Eve for a few hours. \nFull-scale DDoS attacks are incredibly difficult to defend against. Even an attack that is successfully defended against will most likely result in some loss of service. The best way to protect against an attack is to get it away from the network. Since a DDoS attack directs traffic to single network connection, if the traffic is sent somewhere else then the network connection is free to respond to legitimate requests. Lastly talk to your Internet Service Provider and get them to block the things deemed malicious or unnecessary so it never gets a chance to hit the network.\nCitation\nZetter, K. (2016, January 16).

A logic bomb is malware that is triggered by a certain event such as logging into an account or by being a specific date and time. (Armendariz, 2016) Logic bombs can be placed in fake applications that would trigger the logic bomb if the fake application is used or by a Trojan horse. (Armendariz, 2016) An example of using a logic bomb would be downloading something from a site that could be potentially dangerous. Businesses affected by a logic bomb could be banks because it manages a lot of money and someone getting the information through the use of a logic bomb is dangerous to the bank and its customers. The customer could lose access to their bank account and the money that was stored and the bank could face a bad reputation for not being secure enough. Another example could be insurance companies because someone could use a logic bomb to get information on the user such as their social security number. An incident of a logic bomb going off was in South Korea. South Korea had some banks and broadcasting companies that had their hard drives and master boot records wiped with some ATMs not working. (Zetter, 2016) Some ways a person can protect themselves is by not pirating things on the internet, downloading things from trusted sites, and being careful with opening attachments from emails. A business can protect itself by restricting what its employees can do and being prepared for a logic bomb going off by having backed up data to recover from the attack.

Some scammers will cheat and manipulate all what they say just to get your money and attacks like this are transforming every day from recorded messages and special promotions. They are always quick talkers and try to not give you much time to think about the situation and call to say yes and agree. Some can be obvious that they’re scammers but some are cunning in ways that even when you ask for more information they will keep playing a story and try misleading the customer. Like they might use a website or information featuring other happy customers that most likely is as fake as the call. Some calls can start out by saying “you’ve been specially selected for this offer…”; “you’ll get a free bonus if you buy our product…”; “you’ve won one of five valuable prizes.” Scammers will usually use prizes, products, or services as bait such as travel packages, credit/loans, investment opportunity, charity, free trial offer, etc. \n\tEveryone is a potential target; fraud isn’t limited to anyone but some scams are actually concentrated on certain groups or people. For example, people from foreign countries which might be targeted for travel type scams since they’re more likely to travel, or older people may be targeted since they’re older and might live alone and polite towards strangers. Businesses most likely to become under attack would be smaller companies that’s still not big enough to have stable educated employees, or not all systems are protected and encrypted. \n\tThere are so many ways phishing could be used, for examples phone call or email or ads to get sensitive information about you. So, when you think something is suspicious then you should take your time and make sure your making a right decision, it might cost you so much more in the long run. It might sound too good to be true and that’s exactly because it most likely can be false. To handle one of a potential scammer you can ask questions to see what response you can get from them or simply ask yourself some question and think for a minute. Some questions are as follows: “Who’s calling and why?.. What’s the hurry?... If it’s free, why are they asking me to pay?... Why am I confirming my account information or giving it out?... What time is it?... Do I want more calls like this one?” (“Phone Scams,” 2014). Companies need to have security measures and proper educated employees on what web surfing is safe. Also a good way for a company to be safe is to encrypt all their data and have the only tool to decrypt it, or a web filter to look out for attackers. If there’s any reason for sensitive information to be given out or “confirmed” with a random or unexpected call/text email/ad or any way of communication device, then it should be thought of thoroughly and do some research on the web for similar scenarios some are publicly published to warn the public.\n                                                                                  Citation\nPhone Scams.

    "Q3": "Password Attacks\n\nPassword attacks is breaking a secured system by hacking a user's password using different programs. the stronger the password, the harder for a hacker to break a system. Password attacks can be accomplished by following one of the two methods, the Brute-force attack, and the dictionary attack. In the brute-force attacking method, the hacker tries all the combination of letters, symbols, and numbers to figure out the password. This could be done using different  programs such as Zip password cracker Pro. Following this method takes a long time, but it is still commonly used. In the dictionary method, the hacker uses a dictionary to crack a password. Therefore, it is always better to use words that are not in the dictionary. \nBusinesses such as credit cards companies, online banking, government database, and many other internet related businesses fall under the danger of this type of hacking. Therefore, all businesses in this circle hire specialists to monitor and track the accounts and detect any possible chance of hacking. \nFew years ago, Sony Playstation online store was hacked and the servers were down for a while to protect the saved customer's credit cards and information. This incident caused a huge harm of millions of dollars to the company. \nA good way to prevent this type of hacking is changing the passwords frequently and monitor the accounts on a daily basis. \n\ncitation: \nTypes of Attacks.

    "Q3": "Phishing scams are a type of cyber-attack that can happen to businesses. According to Indiana University, phishing scams are typically fraudulent email messages appearing to come from legitimate enterprises (e.g., your university, your internet service provider, your bank). These messages usually direct you to a spoofed website or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft (INSERT CITATION). This type of cyber-attack can happen to any businesses but most likely happen to larger businesses and organizations that are more popular. Sometimes all this type of attack requires in to open an email or click a link. An example of a phishing attack would be an email I received a few months ago supposedly from PayPal. The email was formatted almost exactly like an original purchase confirmation from PayPal and had the same kind of language and placing of logo. To the average person it could pass as the real thing. It stated that the confirmation of an $800 purchase I just made from a vendor in Indiana which I certainly did not make. There was a link at the bottom stating if the charge was not made by me or was a mistake, to click it and they can direct me to someone who can help me resolve this matter. Knowing better, I did not click the link but instead opened my browser and logged onto my PayPal account to see the details of this alleged purchase. Of course, there was no purchase made and my account was safe. Looking back to that email, I compared it to other PayPal confirmation emails and I could see the slight differences. There are thousands of examples similar to this and many times people click that link, making their device vulnerable and making themselves vulnerable by providing personal information like passwords, credit card information, etc. Phishing attacks can be prevented by being careful of what emails the user opens and what links they are pressing within those email. It is also important to verify and requests or allegations (like I did with my PayPal account) before taking any further step. Most companies will not ask for personal information via email and it is just better to make that phone call, or take the extra step to verify than providing your SSN or credit card information.",

Flooding attacks, such as DDoS attacks, are often considered much more difficult to recover from than attacks that crash servers because a simple reboot does not resolve the issue. Flooding itself is the forwarding by a router or a communication network of a unit of data, referred to as a packet, to every other network attached to the router to distribute routing information updates. There are different forms of DDoS attacks. Most attacks fall under the following categories: TCP Connect Attacks, which attempts to occupy all of the available connections to a network’s infrastructure such as through firewalls and application servers. Volumetric Attacks, which congest a network or service by consuming much of its available bandwidth. Fragmentation Attacks sends many packets that reduce the performance of the network significantly as the victim attempts to re-assemble the streams. Lastly, application attacks, which target applications or services and are more difficult to detach because the attack is often generated in a low traffic rate. As mentioned, DDoS attacks come in different forms and each disrupts businesses, banks, and other organizations that fall victim to these malicious attacks throughout the year. \nAccording to the ATLAS Threat Report, there are more than 2,000 DDoS attacks conducted daily. One-third of downtime incidents reported are attributed to DDoS attacks; network downtime is not the only impact that DDoS attacks have. According to a 2014 report from the security firm, Imperva Incapsula, 52% of attacks originate from only ten countries. These being India, China, Iran, Indonesia, United States, Thailand, Turkey, Russia, Vietnam, and Peru. With thousands of malicious DDoS attacks being conducted every day, some industries have found themselves more prone to these attacks than others. Three of the most attacked industries according to ALM Media, include the gaming industry, which is the most targeted industry accounting for over 45% of total attacks. The software and technology industry reports the second-greatest number of attacks at 22% - with their infrastructure-layer being the primary target for attacks. The media and entertainment industry ranks third at 15%. It is one of the most targeted industries for hackers as they are mostly hit with SYN and UDP floods, which are forms of DDoS attacks. \nFurthermore, the Atlantic Monthly Group reports that for one-third of companies, a single hour of a DDoS attack can negatively impact their revenue – costing an estimate of $20,000 per hour. For other companies, the cost of an attack may exceed $100,000 per hour. In 2010, Virgin Blue lost approximately $20 million over a DDoS attack that causes a network outage for eleven days. Revenue is essentially the biggest impact these attacks may have on businesses. A DDoS attack creates a negative view for companies. People that attempt to access the company’s network won’t have access. Therefore, if current and potential customers see that the security their personal information may be at risk, then the overall reputation of that company is severely damaged. 2016 marked a year for numerous major DDoS incidences, some include Russian banks, Sberbank and Alfabank falling victim to several waves of DDoS attacks for a two-day period; this attack was one of the first times attacked conducted massive attacks against Russian banks since 2015. The 2016 Rio Summer Olympics suffered DDoS attacks for numerous months. Presidential nominees Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump’s campaign websites were manipulated due to DDoS attacks but lasted only 30 seconds. \nDDoS attacks are evolving as technology continues to advance by the year. These attackers have begun targeting mobile devices as they have become such an essential tool in our everyday lives. Attacks will continue to get stronger and more disruptive to both industries and even for those that use technology with no malicious intent. Therefore, it is essential for those everywhere to act to protect against future DDoS attacks.  \n\f\n\nBibliography\n\nBisson, David. (2016, November 29).

These attacks can come at any moment and they are very deceiving because it can be a click away from installing a virus on your computer. Another item people should be aware of is that very common passwords can be the source of attacks that is why when you are setting up a professional account you have to make a creative password with symbols and numbers, plus you need to change them every 3 months. Any type of business can be attacked in this situation like hospitals, celebrity accounts, facebook account and so much more. For example, in the article that I was reading, hackers were able to reset passwords to the account of Citrix’s GoToMyPC. This account is basically a cloud service provided by Citrix, where you can store all of your information over the internet in your own storage. The password accounts to this system were hacked by accessing a “list of email address and passwords from other online services that have been hacked in the past.” There was rise in attempted logins in different accounts, for example there were about 117 million LinkedIn accounts that tried to be accessed. Speaking of attacks another one are virus attacks. In another article they talked about the 10 worst virus attacks for computers. Picking a virus from random, lets talk about Regin.

Communications of the ACM, 55(1), 74-81.\n\n\nPhishing attack is when a criminal uses spoofed emails to get people to share sensitive information with them This is normally done by sending what appears to be a regular email but when the person opens the email a virus is than placed on their computer allowing the attacker to have access to information on their computers without their knowledge. Phishing is becoming larger and is now being done by VOIP, text messages, social network sites and even multiplayer games. Instead of attackers sending a lot of emails to just anyone they now send it to a select group of people so is less detectable. \nIn the world today no business is safe from phishing because the attackers are not normally looking for a huge thing which will bring a business down but to obtain money and information. A way a hacker could easily phish a company is by sending them an email asking them to donate money to a worthy cause. They will then be sent to a website where they have to fill in the information needed but because the website is not safe the company has given their bank account number to the attacker. On social media sites an attacker can easily phish you just by having a conversation with you and then asking you questions about your personal life, which many times may seem like a regular conversation but those information can easily allow them to obtain answers to what your passwords could be and they can use that to hack into your computer and get the information in which they need. \nThere are several ways in which to prevent phishing. The most important one is to become educated. Education is most important because if you know what phishing is and how attackers normally phish you will be least likely to fall for their traps. Another is to be observant if you receive an email or a message from someone or on a website and you feel as if it is a little out the ordinary than verify before continuing with it. If you feel something cannot be trusted inform someone who will be able to take a look into it.",

    "Q3": "Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as passwords and card details for malicious reasons. it is carried out in many forms such as email spoofing an instant messaging. It usually directs people to enter personal information website that is fake but looks like a legitimate website. Many websites are susceptible to phishing. Websites like social networks, auction sites, banks an online payment centers. Cyber security experts say that you can usually tell by checking the email address that has sent the email. Also email services such as Google and Microsoft now have ways to filter out these unlawful fraudulent emails. Another incident is concerning tax information because of the coming deadline for taxes. Attempts have been much more prevalent during this time in order to steal taxpayer data. As a result of this, authorities have advised tax professionals to be on guard. The Internal Revenue Service has already been advising many state and other tax agencies to be aware of phishing emails. Also, they have been telling people to check official IRS website and with official representatives in order to make sure the emails that they receive are in fact authentic. Jefferson Graham, of USA today, has identified many ways to combat phishing. For example, he says to be wary of emails with link requests, and to remember that company you do not ask for passwords and emails. They are not the most intricate methods but they are very effective. \n\n\n\nW. (2017, April 03). Email phishing scam targeting Netflix customers becoming more widespread.

    "Q3": "A logic bomb attack is a virus that is planted on a computer or system that does not take effect right away. It waits for either a time or condition to unleash all that is bad onto the system. They are not the most common type of attack but are the type to easily make the news. “Every time a logic bomb is used in a high-profile attack, it seems like it is being discovered for the first time” (Lewis, 2013). They require a lot of planning and are usually done by someone who is on the inside and are upset for some reason, like they know they’ll be fired soon. This is when the timer comes into play so that the logic bomb goes off after they leave. They can also be created by outside sources that found a backdoor into a system. They can type up some code that can do anything from deleting information to causing data to leak or become untrustworthy, but there are ways to prevent these attacks. A company can use logs and monitoring to see if any malicious code has been uploaded. It’s usually best to hire a security firm though.\n\tThe South Korea attack was done by someone who found a way into the system through an email that contained malware. It was spotted by a security firm on the 19th and the attack was on the 20th so the timer set was very short. “The attack, which struck machines on March 20, wiped the hard drives and master boot record of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously” (Zetter, 2013). A huge amount of ATMs were unusable to the people. There are not any specific numbers as to how much money or resources were lost which is to be expected. Most companies don’t want to show large losses to the public. They believe the attack was committed to a group known as WhoIs and all they did was upload 9 files from several different URLS, not that it was an easy task to do. It only took 9 files to go undetected as malware to erase a very large amount of data simultaneously.\n\tEven though logic bombs are not the most common attacks it is important to attempt to stay protected and they can cause a lot of damage. It may be difficult to keep track of all the potential threats a company can have at any one time but it is their job to do everything they can to prevent attacks like these from happening. If an attack has happened before it is most likely going to happen again, so it’s never a good idea to disregard any attacks just because they have not happened in a while. Things always happen when they are least expected and guards are down.\nCitation\nLewis, N. (2013, June). Understanding logic bomb attacks: Examples and countermeasures.

    "Q3": "Mirai Botnet Attack on Dyn Servers\n\nCybersecurity is a growing concern among industries, corporations, and governments. Security experts must deal with hackers, malware, viruses, and other increasingly innovative methods. One method, the Botnet, works by “enslaving” other computers, sometimes called “zombies” to do their bidding, usually by Distributed Denial of Service attacks, where many computers bombard a targeted network with bogus requests for information. The network is overwhelmed and goes down due to the sheer number. The difficulty of defense is identifying legitimate and attacking traffic. A botnet is distinguishable from other DDoS attacks by the use of command-and-control software, where a “lead” computer directly controls the actions of unwitting zombie computers (Jerkins, 2017). As the number of internet-connected devices grows, so does the threat of Botnets. The most recent major botnet attacks were from the Mirai Botnet. First used to attack a security blogger’s website in September, 2016, it was later used to attack the major DNS provider Dyn in October, 2016 (Jerkins, 2017).\n\nThe first attack occurred on September 20, 2016, against a noted security blogger. This was later followed up by a massive assault against Dyn, a major DNS provider, on October 21, 2016. The DDoS attack began with a first wave earlier in the day, followed by a second later on. While Mirai was not the only botnet employed, it produced a majority of attack traffic. The incident disrupted the internet across much of the United States, in particular a targeting of the eastern US. By the time the second wave began, Dyn security experts were more prepared, mitigating its effects. Their methods included traffic-shaping, rebalancing of traffic, and application of internal filtering and scrubbing. Dyn later reported that the attack was particularly devastating because of recursive DNS retry traffic, which is traffic from legitimate sources attempting to reconnect, worsening the impact of the botnet (Hilton, 2016). Currently, there are no monetary estimates of damage, but millions of customers were affected. The attack was notable for two reasons; its size and method. If reports are accurate, the attack was the largest such DDoS botnet attack in history, almost twice the size of the next largest known. How was this possible? It may be related to how Mirai works. Whereas most older botnets worked by infecting computers only, Mirai exploited the “internet of things”. The internet of things, or IoT, is simply a term for all internet-connected devices: DVRs, Blu-Ray players, digital cameras, phones, webcams, even refrigerators (Woolf, 2016). Over 100,000 devices comprised in the attack. The difficulty of stopping DDoS attacks and the lack of IoT security makes Mirai particularly virulent. Since the attack, the code has been published, making it available for anyone interested in utilizing the botnet for their own attacks. Deutsche Telekom in Germany and TalkTalk routers in the UK have both come under attack as well (Newman, 2016). The original author of the Mirai botnet is unknown, as are the identities of the perpetrators of the Dyn attack, although it has been theorized that they were hackers angry at Dyn for assisting the FBI in arresting two Israeli hackers (Schneier, 2016)\n\nThe biggest impact of the Mirai botnet has been to bring to light the implications of insecure IoT devices, and how they can be harnessed by adversaries to further their ends. Unfortunately, it is unclear if any significant change will come from the attack. There is little incentive for manufacturers to address insecurity in most IoT devices (Jerkins, 2016). DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to complete defend against, and there is not significant regulatory pressure on the government or DNS providers. Better security is achievable, but difficult, and it may take an even more impactful attack to push them into action.\n\n\n\nHilton, S. (2016). Dyn analysis summary of Friday October 21 attack.

    "Q3": "A logic bomb is a piece of code that is inserted into a software that executes when a certain condition becomes true. An example of when a logic bomb was used was when North Korea sent phishing emails to South Korean organizations. The email disguised itself as an email from a bank so that the user would open it without suspicion of it being a cyber attack. When the employees opened the email containing a trojan horse the email forcefully downloaded 9 files from different URLs that contained the logic bomb which was set off when the internal clock on the computers hit 14:00:01. This resulted in the machines which overwrite the hard drive and master booted the records and rebooted the system. After the system was rebooted users saw a message on the screen saying “Boot device not found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk.” and displayed a note that the hackers left behind. \nThe result of the hack put several atm’s to go out of operation which froze all banking machines across the country and cause a few media companies to go into shutdown mode. Since the attack only briefly interrupted, the media was still able to broadcast its daily programs and everything went back to normal after the attack. The Korean Communication Commission or KCC traced the attack back to China, Europe, and the United States. However,  they eventually traced the attack back to North Korea. Even though the source of the hack was clear the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army denied any and all ties relating to the cyber-attacks on South Korea and blamed South Korea for being hacked. \nThe lesson learned here is that nobody is safe from hacks or any type of cyber attacks regardless of who you are. In addition to that users should not open anything without properly checking the source of what they are opening since some of the files that you open might contain a logic bomb and other malicious software. I believe that this incident may have been averted if there were more security measures in place and stricter policy enforced.  \n\nSystems, L. H. (2013, April 15).

The attackers used phishing attacks to obtain the information needed to access three major power distribution centers in Ukraine. Once they had access the attackers connected to employee’s computers remotely and locked the employees out of their own machines while the attackers disabled breakers. All three distribution centers were hit simultaneously, resulting in over 230,000 residents losing power. The attackers also cut the backup power supplies at the distribution centers themselves, leaving the employees in the dark. Finally, the attackers used denial of service attacks on the call-centers to prevent customers from quickly getting information about the blackout.\n\tInvestigations of the attack tell us that it was very carefully planned, and executed by professionals who were likely well-funded. Ukraine was quick to point the blame towards Russia, but there is no real evidence on who lead the attack. It is likely however that the attack was performed as a political move, rather than cybercriminals just trying to cause damage because there was no gain for an individual or independent group leading this attack. The attack seemed to simply send a message to Ukraine, maybe one along the lines of “I can take away your power.” Meant both figuratively and literally.\n\tThe power was only out for a maximum of six hours, so the attack didn’t have too large of an effect on consumers. However, the damage done to the distribution centers was more long-lasting. An article titled “Inside the Cunning Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid” stated that “Attackers overwrote firmware on critical devices at 16 of the substations, leaving them unresponsive to any remote commands from operators. The power is on, but workers still have to control the breakers manually.” (Zetter, 2016)\n\tUkraine’s power control systems are more secure than systems in the U.S due to being well segmented with robust firewall. However, this clearly wasn’t enough to keep hackers out. If the distribution centers had used some form of two-factor-authentication then the hackers never would have been able to gain access to critical systems in the first place. But since the control centers did not use this crucial layer of security, the hackers were able to access all the employee systems by simply using social engineering to obtain employee logins.\n \nReferences\nZetter, K., (2016, March 3).

    "Q3": "Christopher Boyer\nIS 300 Section 3\nApril 23rd, 2017\nCyber Assignment #2\nUkraine Power Grid Attack\n\n\tIn late December, 2013 hackers launched what is believed to be the first ever cyber attacks against a power grid at 3 major Ukrainian power substations. Unidentified hijackers were able to implement a slew of different cyber attacks in order to take control of substation supervisory controller, shut down power to parts of western Ukraine, block customer complaint calls, and lock substation workers out of their computers to prevent efforts to restore power. \n\tAccording to Zetter (2016),” as one worker was organizing his papers at his desk that day, the cursor on his computer suddenly skittered across the screen of its own accord”. The attack started with  a worker at the Prykarpattyaoblenergo control center noticing that he no longer had control over his own computer, a supervisory computer used to control main breakers for large scale power distribution. Once the hijacker had control of the supervisory computer, they began to override the breakers that were controller by the substation and removed power from customers throughout the substation’s service area. Before employees could react, the hijackers locked them out of their own control by changing the credentials for their accounts, rendering them helpless. This same process had been implemented at 2 other control centers in Ukraine. Once power had been taken away from the customers, the hackers implemented a Denial of Service attack on the customer call centers by clogging up the call centers with a seemingly limitless volume of fake calls that were addressed to Moscow. The fact that the fake calls were registering as though they were from Moscow has lead experts to believe that the attack was led by the Russian hacking group known as “Sandworm”. The hackers disabled the plant’s UPS systems, which prevented backup generators from providing the control center power so even the employees were suffering from the outage. Reports suggest that nearly 1.5% of Ukraine’s daily power consumption was missed throughout the course of the attack. \n\tThere were 3 types of cyber attacks implemented in this attack, the first was a spyware or keylogger implemented to collect sets of credentials from employees of the Ukrainian control center. The spyware was put in place to allow the hackers to gather information that would eventually allow them to access the user accounts of employees with high levels of access. A Remote Access attack was then utilized to grant the hijackers access to the actual computers used to control the systems at the substations. Since there were no two-factor authentication securities in place for the employees, once the hackers had access to the supervisory controllers of the control centers, they were able to take full control. One of their first steps was resetting the passwords of the employees so that they could not interfere with or undo any of the hacker’s efforts. As customer power began shutting off, the hackers then implemented a Denial of Service attack. The hackers denied service by sending the control center’s call centers an extremely high volume of fake calls so that customer calls would not make it in. \n\tThe hackers of the Ukrainian power grid did not cause any physical damage, and I was not able to find any reports of damages caused by the subsequent loss of power to the customers, however, they could have done far worse than they did. Hackers have since been able to demonstrate that with only a few lines of malicious code that they have the capability to physically damage power generation equipment in tests held by the US government (Zetter, 2016).\n\tThere are many reasons why this event may have taken place, it is obvious that one of the intentions of the attack was to weaken the Ukrainian public’s faith in their own government’s ability to protect their power grid. The hack could easily have been a far more devastating, crippling attack on the country’s power grid, however, the hackers chose not to go as far as they could have. The event seemed to be less of a full blown attack and more of a warning. Due to the recent tensions between Russia and the Ukraine, this could easily be seen as a warning of what might come if the tensions continue to escalate. \n \nBibliography:\nZetter, K.

The cyber-attack was timed and it cost the companies dearly. The attack was created by a group of hackers called, WhoIs trying to cause chaos for the business.  \n      A Logic Bomb is a segment of code programmed into a malicious software to go off at a set time. The bomb can be used to do everything from seizing the computer, slowing them down, or in this instance deleting records and data. The code is a program or any number of computer software that may appear legitimate but, contains malicious software that can be set off at a particular time. This malicious code is installed with the program. Although the program is installed with the malicious software; the computer systems remain unaffected at the time of the installation. \n      The attack on South Korea’s companies was timed to remove data at a set time interval. All the broadcasting and bank data were deleted. The file was distributed by the hacker group on March 19th. The files were sent as a spam email to many North Korean companies containing nine different files from several different rules. The attacks took out several ATM’s and prevented many South Korean’s from withdrawing money. The malware contained data for deleting data on Linux machines directly attacking the company’s infrastructure. Richard Henderson stated that “they weren’t just looking to attack desktops; they were looking to attack stuff on the infrastructure side as well.” The attack should have been prevented had processions taken place. Firstly, the software should have been identified by the necessary people and isolated. This would have prevented the software from taking a hold on more computers. Secondly, the software could have been detected by antivirus or malware. The software should have detected that the master boot record was being accessed and cut it off. Thirdly, the staff should have been informed not to open strange emails. This is a common tactic that many people forget if a user accesses the file then the network is compromised. It is up to the user to isolate that computer or give it to someone that can.   \n          \n      \n          \nCitation\nZetter, K. (2013, March 21). Logic Bomb Set Off South Korea Cyberattack.

Due to the nature of the attack, many South Korean citizens were unable to withdraw money from ATM’s or receive information or basic programming from the downed broadcasters for a short duration.  The attack was generated from a Chinese source, but speculation points to North Korean hackers or hackers contracted by North Korea living in China to have conducted the malware attack.\n  \nSuch targeted attacks have occurred more than once against South Korean businesses and its citizens.  While damages to businesses can be assessed through losses in profits or stolen information, it’s almost impossible to tell what kind of damage has been caused to the public as personal money or information can be stolen, for example.  It’s also difficult to assess the extent of the damage as the government and businesses don’t want to inadvertently inform their attackers the severity of the damage. \n\nThe resulting aftermath found all affected groups resume their respective services, but under greater duress for a repeat attack and under scrutiny from the public to do more to protect their information (especially from the banks).

    "Q3": "Cyber attacks and theft have become an unfortunate part of our society. More specifically, the theft of payment card information. Major retails are no exception to this form of theft. In November and December 2013, cyber thieves executed a successful cyber attack against Target, one of the largest retail companies in the United States. The attackers surreptitiously gained access to Target’s computer network, stole the financial and personal information of as many as 110 million Target customers, and then removed this sensitive information from Target’s network to a server in Eastern Europe (Finkle & Skariachan, 2013). Target revealed that a third party gained access to a huge trove of customer data, which included names, credit card numbers, expiration dates, and the three-digit security codes typically found on the back of credit cards. The breach is the latest in a string of hacks that have targeted brick-and-mortar stores in much the same way websites are often attacked (Luckerson, 2013). \nThe Target press release was published after the breach was first reported on December 18 by Brian Krebs, an independent Internet security news and investigative reporter. Target officials have testified before Congress that they were not aware of the breach until contacted by the Department of Justice on December 12. The data breach affected cards used in U.S. Target stores between November 27 and December 18, 2013 (Target, 2013). The retailer was alerted its systems might have been compromised by credit card processors who had noticed a surge in fraudulent transactions involving credit cards that had been used at Target, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss the matter. The timing of the breach could not have been worse for Target, coming just before three of the four busiest days of what has been a bruising holiday season for retailers, with the highest level of discounting in years. Target itself last month lowered its profit forecast for the year after disappointing sales in the third quarter.\n\tOn January 12, Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel confirmed that malware installed on point of sale (POS) terminals at U.S. based Target stores enabled the theft of financial information from 40 million credit and debit cards. This malware utilized a so called “RAM scraping” attack, which allowed for the collection of unencrypted, plaintext data as it passed through the infected POS machine’s memory before transfer to the company’s payment processing provider. According to reports by Brian Krebs, a tailored version of the “BlackPOS” malware available on black market cyber crime forums for between $1,800 and $2,300 was installed on Target’s \nPOS machines (Finkle & Skariachan, 2013). An employee could have purposefully left a backdoor open for hackers or unknowingly clicked a link that allowed an entry point for the malware or some other malicious code. The company’s wireless network also could also have been compromised. The scope of the Target theft—and the fact that it hit during the busiest shopping season—means it was probably the work of organized cyber criminals who had planned for it well in advance. \nTarget has advised everyone who shopped at their stores during the two-and-a-half week period when the attack happened to monitor their bank accounts closely, even though the company says they’ve resolved the issue that led to the breach. Analysts say physical retailers may be more susceptible to damaging online attacks than Internet companies, whose entire credibility is often built on protecting users’ data on the Web. Certainly, the stakes for a company like Target are higher (Luckerson, 2013). After the data breach was discovered, Target offered one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to all customers who shopped in U.S. stores. Target resolved the issue by agreeing to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit related to the company's 2013 data breach. Court documents show hacking victims could get as much as $10,000 a piece (Pagliery, J., & Riley, C., 2015). \nSince then, companies have gotten far more adept at identifying intruders. But criminals have responded by developing more-powerful attack strategies, spending months on reconnaissance to launch highly sophisticated schemes with the goal of extracting as much data as they can in the shortest period of time (Finkle & Skariachan, 2013). After such a massive loss, target certainly learned their lesson and have agreed to improve its data security, including the designation of a chief information security officer. A corporate webpage describes changes made by the company regarding their security posture, including the following: Improved monitoring and logging of system activity, installed application whitelisting POS systems and implemented POS management tools, improved firewall rules and policies, limited or disabled vendor access to their network, disabled, reset, or reduced privileges on over 445,000 Target personnel and contractor accounts, expanded the use of two-factor authentication and password vaults, and finally trained individuals on password rotation (Target, 2013). If these changes have been implemented as Target describes, they would help address the weaknesses exploited during the attack. What happened to target and its customers in 2013 was extremely unfortunate. But, it certainly was an eye opener on how cyber-attacks need to be taken more seriously, more specifically, preventing them from happening again. \n\t \nWorks Cited\nFinkle, J., & Skariachan, D.

    "Q3": "Mamadou Guiro\nApril 26, 2017\nIS 300, Section 3\nCyber Issue 2\n\nOn December 18, 2013, the blog KrebsonSecurity revealed that Target, one of the biggest retail stores in the US, was investigating a data breach that potentially concerned millions of customers making credit and debit cards payments in its US stores. The next day, Target confirmed the data breach and revealed that 40 million credit and debit card accounts had been possibly impacted between November 27 and December 15, 2013. And, as if that weren’t bad enough, the retailer later stated that the stolen information included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses for an additional 70 million Target shoppers.  Astonishingly, Target found out about the breach only when they were alerted by Federal law enforcement officials, according to the blog naked security.\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, the hackers used credentials of an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning) vendor to break into Target’s network and installed two malwares. They sent a credit card number-stealing malware to cashier stations in all US Target stores. They installed a second malware that sent the stolen data to different servers in the US before the data flew out to Eastern Europe. Consequently, an estimated 40 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen, about 70 million records that included the name, address, phone number, and email address were stolen according to KrebsonSecurity. Also, Target had a drop of 46% in profits in the fourth quarter of 2013, and 200 million dollars were spent for reissuing cards.\nIncredibly, Target was prepared for such an attack. Months ago, Target had spent 1.6 million dollars in malware detection tool made by the computer security firm FireEye, whose customers also include the CIA and the Pentagon, according to Bloomberg. The retailer had a team of security specialists in Bangalore, India to monitor its computer systems. Bloomberg reported that the team in Bangalore alerted Target’s headquarters in the US, but nothing was done. Even worse, Target’s security team had disabled a feature on the system that would have automatically eliminated the malware upon detection without any human intervention, Bloomberg reported.\nTarget learned the hard way that vendors should have restricted or very limited access to their networks. They also understood that malware detection tools are of the utmost importance in preventing such attacks. Because of the breach, Target took important measures to improve security. After the breach, Target improved monitoring and logging of system activity, installed application whitelisting POS systems and implemented POS management tools, improved firewall rules and policies, limited or disabled vendor access to their network, disabled, reset or reduced privileges on over 445,000 Target personnel and contractor accounts, expanded the use of two-factor authentication and password vaults, and trained personnel on password rotation.\nIn sum, the Target data breach of 2013 has been very devastating for Target, and affected a staggering number of over 110 million Target shoppers. However, the cyber-attack could have been easily prevented for two simple reasons. First, the HVAC vendor should have had a very restricted access to its sensitive data. Secondly, the Target security team should have taken seriously the warning signs regarding the attack, not to mention the disabling of some features of the Fire Eye detection tool. The Target breach should be regarded as a wakeup call to all businesses, and they should take all measures to protect the data that they collect from their customers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations:\nKrebs B.

    "Q3": "The hack I choose to look into were the attacks on Ukraine’s power grid. We should always be vigilant of a cyber attack. They can cause immense damage and be expensive to fix. One small misstep and your systems can be compromised. I will go into detail of the attack on Ukraine's power grid on Dec 2015.\n\n    The hackers started their attack with phishing emails targeting low level employees at different power distribution companies. These emails contained word documents that asked for permissions for a macro which held the BlackEnergy malware. Once the worker accepted the macro this opened the backdoor and allowed the hackers to get into the corporate networks. The hackers now had to find a way into the SCADA network (Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition) which controlled the power grid. SCADA doesn’t require two way authentication, the hackers used this to their advantage. They gained access to the Windows Domain Controllers which provided them worker credentials that allowed them to remotely log on to the SCADA network. Once in the SCADA network they had free reign. They first reconfigured the UPS for two stations so that they would be affected by the blackout as well. From there Zetter (2016) says,\n    they wrote malicious firmware to replace the legitimate firmware on serial-to-Ethernet \n    converters at more than a dozen substations (the converters are used to process commands sent from           \n    the SCADA network to the substation control systems). Taking out the converters would prevent   \n    operators from sending remote commands to re-close breakers once a blackout occurred.\nThey also did a TDoS attack (basically send a lot of traffic to phone lines so real calls can’t get through) to prevent people affected by the blackouts to call in reporting the power shortage. Lastly they used KillDisk malware to wipe files from operator station by a logic bomb attack as it occurred a hour and half after the initial attack. I could not find the estimated damages but because of the malicious firmware rewrite of 16 critical devices at the substations,  these devices will need to be replaced. I don’t know what they cost but I don’t imagine them to be cheap. The suspected culprit for this attack was a professional Russian hacker group called Sandworm. The targeted audience were the Ukrainian people. The reason for the TDoS attack was believed to be a way to make Ukrainian citizens question their government as the Ukraine-Russian war was going on at the time. Russia wanted more pro Russia support and an attack that makes the Ukrainian government look incompetent would be strategically beneficial for them. The power went out for 6 hours during this attack and left physical damage to the power distribution companies in Ukraine leaving them semi-operational. The lessons learned from this attack are that it’s a good idea to log things such as firewall and system logs as it helped immensely with the reconstruction. Another thing that's an important take away is that two way authentication is crucial to protect your system and having that for SCADA would of prevented the attack. Another thing that can be learned is that employers should warn of the dangers of opening and downloading random things from an email. This was how how the attack started and if those 3 employees didn’t download the macro this could have all been avoided.\n\n    This attack caused 230000 residents to go dark. The implications of what an attack of greater scale is freighting. We must learn from this and take precautions to avoid a scenario like this in the future. \n\n                                                                                Citation\nZetter, K.

Their investigation led them to suspect the breach could have started as early as April of 2014 (Hawkins). The goal of this breach was to steal personal information including payment card data for gain. The scope of the breach is reported to include 53 million email addresses and affect 56 million credit cards (Kerner). It is also believed that the attacker had access to third party credentials to gain this information (Kerner).  Since then, Home Depot accelerated their plans to upgrade to chip and pin card systems, which are expected to reduce the likelihood of falsifying their customers’ cards (Hawkins). Home Depot also worked on a project allowing better encryption of all their card data. This encryption technology was provided by Voltage Security and has been extensively tested, though the details have not been made public (Rash).  \nReferences:\nHawkins, B. (2015).

    "Q3": "Mark Minnis\nIS 300, section 3\nCyber Assignment 2\n4/26/17\n\n\n\tIn the world we live in today, security is an extremely interesting and important topic. Everybody is trying to find the most secure way to protect their personal information. However sometimes it is not one individual persons fault when someone’s information is stolen, but it is the fault of a business or organization that also had access to your information. This was the case for the retail sore, Target in the fall of 2013, when the credit card information of nearly 70 million customers were compromised. \n\tThe hackers were able to carry out this cyber-attack on Target, by compromising one of their third party vendors. The attackers were able to compromise this third party vendor by using “a phishing email” (Kassner, 2015). This is when a seemingly normal email is sent to an individual or business and the person who receives it thinks nothing of it. However once the email is received and it has been opened, the virus and malware that was hidden in the email can go to work. In this particular case, the Trojan virus was able to access the login credentials of the third party vendors. Now there has been no clear explanation on how these attackers were able to enter Targets internal systems, however many experts believe that “attackers got to work figuring out which portal to subvert and use as a staging point into Target's internal network” (Kassner, 2015). This means that once the attackers had the credentials to login into the third party vendors system they were able to navigate that system until they found a vulnerable area to hack into Target’s internal system. Some people might be wondering how no one noticed this authorized access into Targets system, and the answer to this seems to be that there were warnings, but these warnings were ignored. Michael Kassner of ZDnet says “a malware detection tool made by the computer security firm FireEye was in place and sent an alarm, but the warning went unheeded.” (Kassner, 2015)\n\tThe affected parties from this attack not only include the businesses that were comprised, but most importantly the customers who had their credit information stolen. Everybody is constantly making sure that no one has access to their confidential information because when that information falls into the wrong hands it is incredibly hard to reverse any damage that is done. This also hurts the business because customers will be weary to trust that business with their information in the future. Target estimated that “fourth quarter earnings to fall in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share”, (McGrath, 2014) and that “a comparable sales decline of 2.5%, versus its prior guidance of flat comparable sales”(McGrath, 2014).\n\tThis shows why security is such a pressing issue in our society. Nobody wants to have their information stolen and used by somebody because that can effectively ruin someone’s life. On the flip side of this, no business wants to be in the national spotlight because their systems were hacked and they lost millions and millions of confidential customer information. This is why every person, organization, and business needs to make security a priority to protect their information.  \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \nMcGrath, M. (2014). Forbes Welcome. Forbes.com.

    "Q3": "The attack on Target in 2013 was a data breach, which is defined as confidential data being stolen by someone who is unauthorized for that data. On December 19th target said \"that as many as 40 million credit card\" (Mcgrath) accounts may have been compromised, and it was late found that 70 million user's data had been stolen. It was done by hackers who had their data severs in Russia, which was picked up by FireEye. It's also said that Target was alerted of the breach but for some reason didn’t respond when alerted. The reasoning has not been explained as to why they didn't respond, though Target has stated it is looking into why it never reacted to the alert.\n\nAccording to Mintz Levin, the total cost of the breach was 191 million. These expenses included 46 million for insurance and 145 million for the charges against Target. In 2014 there was an additional  61 million in breach related expenses and another 41 million for the insurance. This is all in relation to the 2013 breach. It is also said that through 2015 they were still paying for losses and damages.\n \nThe audience were the customers of Target. What was stolen was information on credit cards, email addresses, street addresses, and other general information. People sued Target in response, and this is one of the main reasons they had such a high cost for total damages after the breach. The people felt a huge abuse of their data, especially after it was stated that Target had been alerted to the attack.\n\nTarget paid out a lot to its customers and it doesn’t seem that the culprits were ever caught. This also seems to be a reoccurring theme among other breaches, the people who do this never get caught. It seems that they get away in all the confusion after the event, and that the companies having to deal with the fall out of angry customers makes getting away even easier. Target has also clearly stated that it has worked on many new counter measers and other respones to keep up with threat of another attack.\n\nThe lesson learned here was that breaches can be costly, that they shouldn’t be taken lightly because it's getting easier and easier for hackers to break in. It's also an issue that it is so easy for them to get away, because not only is finding them an issue, but they can also be in another country and getting trans national law to take them down is even more of a difficulty. This breach has also accelerated the use of EMV in the US, it is now a huge part of our daily transactions. Though MV was already on its way into the US, this breach made it a necessity. Target and other retailers have learned how detrimental it can be when underestimating your IS security, and it shows now that Target has increased its IS security staff by tenfold (Bloomberg), this shows that they now expect more when they pay more.\n\nRiley, M., Elgin, B., Lawrence, D., & Matlack, C.

    "Q3": "Breaches in the United States happen all the time. The goal is to prevent them but that only happens after the breach happens. First, we must define the word breach before we continue.\nA breach can be defined as a gap in the wall or barrier made by an attacking enemy. Today we will be talking about the Target Breach in 2013 and how it affected all of us. We will describe this topic in the following stages. A description of the attack, what was the background of this attack, what were the estimated damages, who was the audience and finally what can be learned from this attack.\n\nWe pose the question what was all the hassle about when Target was cyber breached in 2013. This attack took place the night before Christmas in 2013. According to Forbes, “information was stolen between November 27 and December 15, 2013. This included personal information of 70 million people” (McGrath, 2014). That right there is absurd, so many people’s personal information was stolen including their credit and debit card information. The people who are usually behind this attack are hackers. Well the hackers did something very different that changed the way we shop and we needed to learn something from this attack.\n\n\nMany people may ask how did this happen and how were the hackers involved. Well, Money CNN suggested that “hackers attack the retailer’ point of sale system” (CNN Money, 2013). This mean there was some malware system within the credit card machine. Whenever a consumer would swipe their card the hacker would take their credit card information. This means that the audience for this cyber breach would be the consumer that. This shows that within that period of November 27 and December 15 in 2013, the people who shopped there were the target and their vital information was put out to the open. We may ask the question to our self, how much was Target affected through this cyber breach. Within our research, Tech Crunch mentioned the following “Target today said that it has booked $162 million in expenses across 2013 and 2014 related to its data breach” (Lunden, 2015). That right there is a lot of money, but we as Americans must learn from our mistake and make sure this doesn’t happen again. Target has improved their system greatly so this cyber breach would not happen once again. ZD net mentions that target” improved their monitoring and logging of the system activity, installed application whitelisting POS systems” (Kassner, 2015) and so much more. \n\nWe’ve learned today that the Target Cyber breach in 2013 was a very scary breach for the Americans as they hacked the point of sale system and could collect private information of 70 million people. There was huge amount of money that Target had to pay for the damages, but fear not Target has updated their services so this would not happen again.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWorks Cited\n\nMcGrath, M.

The worm at Stuxnet emerged the summer of 2010 and only 500 kilobytes. The worm analyzed and targeted Windows networks and computer systems. Then it infiltrated the Siemens software system, which was prevalent to industrial computing. Finally the worm the worm gained access to industrial program logic controllers. The worm was believed to have been introduced to the system by a random worker's USB drive. The worm was estimated to have destroyed 984 uranium enriching centrifuges, which constituted a 30% decrease in enrichment efficiency. The security firm eventually located the malicious files and were able to take appropriate action to resolve the attack. The maker of the worm is still unknown, though experts believe it to be a joint effort between the United States and Israel. The audience of this attack was the Iranians and the nuclear facilities. The attacker wanted to reduce their efficiency for unknown reasons, but they were successful in doing so. The lesson learned from this attack is that a simple USB and 500 kilobyte software can cause big problems.

    "Q3": "The Home Depot Data breach in 2014 was one of the largest data breaches in US history. It was a classic case of a company not learning from recent history, and negligent security controls. Target, another major retailer, had just been the victim of a data breach that was at the time the largest ever in the US. The unfortunate reality was that Home Depot’s breach was done in a very similar way. Hackers gained access to Home Depot’s network via a third party vendor network, and used that to exploit weakness within the corporate environment. Approximately 56 million cards were stolen (Winter, 2014), and many email addresses. The total cost of the breach, including payments to banks, credit card companies, legal fees, and customers, was upwards of $170 million (Roberts, 2017). These sort of attacks highlight the importance of constant vigilance, especially for large retailers dealing with large amounts of sensitive consumer data.   \n\n     The backdrop that led to the home depot attack was a combination of negligence, old software, and a refusal to learn from the past.  The year before, target had been breached in much the same way. These types of data breaches target large corporations and companies that contain customer data. Attackers gained access through Home Depot’s third party vendor environment, then exploited a hack within the vendor network and gained access to Home Depot’s corporate network. Once there, the hackers were able to install memory scraping malware on more than 7,500 POS terminals across the country. These terminals were running an old and vulnerable OS based on windows XP, which Home Depot failed to update, allowing the malware to be installed.  \n\n     Once the malware was running on the POS terminals, the memory scraping software was able to steal large amounts of data.  Memory scraping malware has been the main method of stealing payment card information in the large retail data breaches of 2014. This malware is able to read the contents of RAM on a POS terminal when the payment card data is present. Once that data is captured, it is sent to servers owned by the attacker. This malware has been effective, as evidence of the recent retail data breaches has shown. It continues to be effective on POS systems that are not properly locked down. \n\n     The damages and resolution costs Home Depot incurred were heavy. They had to pay millions in fees and settlements. A consortium of Visa, MasterCard, and various banks was paid at least $135 million (Roberts, 2017).  This was in addition to $25 million that Home Depot agreed to pay banks as a result of the damages incurred by the breach. To the many consumers affected, Home Depot shelled out almost $20 million, as well as offered credit monitoring service (Winter, 2014). The legal fees associated with various class action law suits may total up to approximately $10 million.  \n\n     These types of breaches can be prevented by knowledgeable and competent security personnel, as well as better control over a corporate environment. To prevent these kinds of breaches entirely, Home Depot should have had more segregation between their different networks, mainly the third party vendor network, which should have had tighter restriction. Additionally, the POS terminals were using an old software, leaving them almost asking for an attack. A result of this incident and recent POS data hack, new credit card standards and security measures have been put in place. Had Home Depot required and had the equipment for chip reader terminals, this could also have been completely avoided, as each sale creates its own data for the terminal. Recently, merchants who are the victims of data hacks and who are not using the pin and chip technology on their POS terminals are now responsible for damages instead of banks.  \n \n     The attack on Home Depot was a major wake up call for more security, and more vigilance. It is notable how Home Depot failed to learn from the Target data hack a year previous, and did not seem to take any action. A proactive approach could have prevented this attack, saving the company millions in legal fees, lawsuits and resolution payments. A complete overview of how Home Depot’s networks were set up, as well as software improvements should have been done before anything happened. Unfortunately, these types of attacks seem to happen often, and with more preventative measures, the frequency and success rate of these breaches can be limited.  \n \nRoberts, J. J. (2017,).

    "Q3": "Stuxnet\n\n\n\tThe evolution of technology had become a huge development for the improvement of many aspects of the humans' life. Innovations and collection of information had become a major assets for many different organizations. This concept is still carried on even when we refer to the concept of war, which is now expanded in a different concept. We used to think of war as the idea of conflicts which consist of human killing and destroying the opponents’ artillery and weapons in order to settle a domination over one another. However, in this modern age of technology, there is another concept of war which is the virtual war consisting of the concept of cyber-attacks. This leads to the concept of cyber-attack mainly concerning about Stuxnet, what is it? What are the potential damages that it could affect? Whom are targeted by this threat? And what is the moral taken from it?\n\nBack in June 2010, a major news came out about the story of a cyber-attack called Stuxnet which targeted Iran’s nuclear plant. The attack was considered by cyber security specialists to be known as the world’s cyber super weapon. In addition to that, according to Mark Clayton’s article who is a staff writer from the Christian Science Monitor, Stuxnet capability is mainly able to go from virtual realm to the real physical world destroying entity such as factory, refinery, and nuclear power plant, which in this case was in Iran. Furthermore, you might wonder what exactly is Stuxnet? According to the Chief technology officer of Resilient System, Inc Bruce Shneier, he stated that: “Stuxnet is an Internet worm that infects Windows computers. It primarily spreads via USB sticks, which allows it to get into computers and networks not normally connected to the internet. Once inside a network, it uses a variety of mechanisms to propagate to other machines within that network and gain privilege once it has infected those machines.” Stuxnet is considered by the computer security specialists to be a very huge, well concealed or incorruptible, and complicated to comprehend malware. The result of Stuxnet attack back in 2010 was damaging the Iranian’s nuclear program which was considered by many countries to be a menace. Besides that attack, other countries 'computers and processing factories had been infected by the propagation of this malware such as, Iran, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Germany and the US. The most frightening concept about the malware is that, it does not steal data, credit card information, nor account information but rather, it takes control of anything that it has corrupted and do whatever it was programmed for. Moreover, according to Clayton, cyber security specialists claim that Stuxnet was so sophisticated malware that its designer must be a group of very highly skilled 8 to 10 individuals who have spend a lot of time, money to achieve such a major attack and propagation. As many issues that are risen, solutions are searched to prevent any attack such as the case of Stuxnet. However, it turns out that an efficient solution to prevent this type of attack is not yet claimed. What is known is that Stuxnet is looking for a Programmable Logic Controller made by Siemens. Due to this reason, a German company Siemens decided to collaborate with the US national laboratory in Idaho to detect the weakness of computer controllers device that Siemens sells around the world. In addition to that, the homeland security joined the Idaho National Laboratory to examine and investigate the conception of the Siemens controllers. The efficient solution had not been found yet, and the result of the research had been classified.\n\nTo conclude, despite that fact that the Stuxnet malware capability does not steal any credit card information nor any personal account information, the matter should be taken very seriously. This is because of the fact that it has a huge scale of propagation, with a huge risks of major damages. Despite that facts, the main creator and the specific target of Stuxnet is still a mystery, and even by conjecture it was created by an unknown government. In addition to that, nobody wants to think to have malware that had been infiltrated to the US national security system that would threaten the whole nation. Thus, it is necessary to really push the laboratory research faster, and come up with some efficient strategies to prevent the attack.\n\nCitations\n\nBroad, W. J., Markoff, J., Sanger, E.

Nowadays cyber attacks target payment cards to steal their information. Attackers implement malware in businesses’ systems in order to steal credit card information. Some, may even use ransomware to obtain bitcoins in exchange for this information. When payment card systems are breached, cyber criminals gain the card information and then sell the information. The buyers of the information then use a pre-paid cards and put the stolen information on it. Many businesses fall victim to these cyber attacks without even realizing it. A business that has fallen victim to this is Home Depot. \n\n        In September of 2014 Home Depot released a statement announcing that 56 million credit cards were compromised in a breach. Home Depot later revealed that along with the 56 million credit card information, 53 million email addresses were also compromised. The Home Depot breach occurred after the Target breach. It was later found that the attackers used similar cyber attack methods as the methods that were used during the Target breach. After an investigation it was revealed that the cyber criminals infiltrated Home Depot’s network through one of their vendor environments. According to a statement from Home Depot, the cyber criminals used third party vendor’s login credentials to enter Home Depot’s network, allowing them to be able to navigate through Home Depot’s network (Smith, 2014). While the attackers navigated through Home Depot’s network they found a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, which then allowed them to plant the malware on Home Depot’s self-checkout stations and obtain the payment card information. This attack greatly impacted Home Depot as a business. \n\n        This attack has damaged Home Depot’s customers’ trust in the business. According to Jeff Roberts, the breach cost Home depot about $179 million (Roberts, 2017). This value will most likely increase when accounting for legal fees and undisclosed payouts. Home Depot has agreed to pay $25 million for damages that have occurred because of the breach. After the breach Home Depot’s IT staff changed their systems from Windows to Mac. After the breach occurred the IT staff bought apple products for the top executives as a preventive measure in case cyber criminals were to try and attack executive’s phones and computers. Also, Home Depot implemented EMV, chip and pin, technology in order to combat and improve their security measures. \n\n        In conclusion, it essential for businesses to properly check and update their security systems in order to protect their network against cyber attacks. Before the Home Depot breach occurred, Target’s systems were breached. Home Depot should have checked their security systems, if they had then this breach may not have occurred. The targeted audience is business owners, IS specialists/employees, and customers. All of these individuals should view Home Depot’s breach as a lesson on how to prevent and protect information from cyber attacks. The lesson learned from this attack is that there are vulnerabilities in systems, so it is essential to routinely check and update systems to protect against cyber attacks and breaches.\n\n\n                                                                      Citation\nRoberts, J.

Target had a data breach that occurred late November around the time of black Friday of 2013. It impacted many customers of Target.\n\nReading an article found on Forbes, the attack consisted of 40 million credit and debit cards being compromised. Customer’s names, credit card, debit card, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers were compromised. The article mentioned that 70 million people were affected. The damages included this information to be used for the attacker’s personal use. The attackers had the ability to create fraudulent credit and debit cards for them to use.\n\nThe information was compromised due to the attackers being able to hack Target’s data system and retrieve many customer’s personal information. As a result, the article states that Target will provide a year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection to all customers within the US.\n\nOverall it is important to understand the safeguards needing to place in limiting vulnerability. The store needs to ensure their security of their databases and systems of where their customer’s information is protected from anyone that doesn’t have a need to know. Data breaches can happen anywhere at any time so it important to ensure all information collected is only used for the company’s needs and is secured.\n\nMcGrath, M.

This software function against users consent and trigger on certain date or time which is set by the malicious developer. This sort of attack can be used to gain control of someone’s computer system and access important databases. A cyber-attack that occurred in South Korea in 2013 wiped the entire hard drive of computer systems of South Korea’s banks and media broadcasting companies. According to a security firm in the U.S, the logic bomb was set off by North Korean government.\n\n         The Logic bomb attack was set off on March 20, 2013. It wiped down master boot record of three main media companies named KBS, MBC and YTN; and two national banks, which were Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup Bank. The attack reportedly took place after 2pm and turned off computer networks of the media companies, which caused them many problems in streaming their video live on air. The attack also placed some ATMs out of operation, which restricted South Koreans from withdrawing cash from their banks. “The malware consisted of four files, including one called AgentBase.exe that triggered the wiping. Contained within that file was a hex string (4DAD4678) indicating the date and time the attack was to begin — March 20, 2013 at 2pm local time (2013-3-20 14:00:00)” (Ryall, 2013). South Korean intelligence agency accused Hyon Yong-Chol, North Korean defense minister, of carrying out the cyber-attack. The authorities reported that the attack was designed to damage government policies and encourage social discord.\n\n          The target audience was South Korean government and their citizen because it caused them economical loss. But the attack was also a warning to the west and the rest of the world that North Korea is capable of such an attack. A research company based in Tokyo called Symantec decoded the malware as Trojan.Jokra and WS. Reputation.1.  They noticed that the program is triggering the command called “taskkill” through Win Exec to stop the network (Ryall, 2013). The researchers then deleted the trojan file and fixed the problem.\n\n      According to the South Korean media, North Korea had over 6,000 cyber warfare worker and South Korea only had 600. After the attack, south Korean learned their lesson that they needed to invest more in their cyber security department.\n\n\nReferences\nSung, Y. (2013, March).

The investigation started on September 2nd when they figured that the breach was to steal payment card information and email addresses. They were able to go through a third-party vendor login for their self-checkout kiosk and switch environments where the third part could make changes to corporate environment where they can see much more. From there the malware was installed to collect the data which totaled about 56 million credit/debit cards and about 53 million email addresses. A very similar attack happened at Target through the same way of hacking and they were also successful in their breach, but no one thought it would happen again. Ram scrapping is the way they were able to grab the data they needed and it is done by being able to read specific parts of the ram so that when the payment information is stored there in plain text it can just copy the information to a server. The estimated total damages were over $180 million based on court documents but it most likely will be higher since costs are still adding up.\n\tA potential target to an attack as this type would be any store with a self-checkout service with a third-party payment system. The number of stores that are now having self-service lanes are growing and it is clearly a possible threat to all stores. The hard thing to believe is that Home Depot was not at fault since it was through a third-party system that they used. But Home Depot had to be responsible in the breach and take action to restore and recover from the event. Compensation to effected customers were given out and also credit card services were offered to whomever was effected. \n\tThere are many ways to defend against a breach, but the problem is you don’t know what kind of breach you might be faced with. One can have security systems and anti-virus programs but still not be able to defend against such attack. Home Depot could have had more security measures to protect the customers and could have had Network Threat Protection or Point-to-Point encryption turned on for their network to be protected that was later discovered. Also, managing third party vendor credentials appropriately is a big part of the breach. The hackers wouldn’t be able to get into the corporate environment if they didn’t have the third-party system credentials which was running Windows XP. Lesson learned by Home Depot and other retailers was to keep up with their network security and manage credentials appropriately. Most importantly is keeping systems up to date since everything around us keeps upgrading and becoming more advanced.\n\n                                                                           Citation\nRoberts, J.

Retrieved April 24, 2017, from http://www.shield.ne.jp/ssrc/topics/SSRC-ER-13-014-en.html\n\n\tThe topic that I selected is the 2013 Logic Bomb attack in South Korea. In the research that I found there are multiple point of view they all called a cyber-attack. In 2013, South Korea was attack by a Logic Bomb that crippled the country. Many of the people in the country want an explanation and who was responsible for the attack. Was it China, North Korea, Russia, or United States of America. \n\tOn March 20, 2013 around 2:00PM, South Korea was attacked by a logic bomb that shut down three broadcasters which are KBS, MBC, and YTN, and three banks which are Jeju, Nonghyup, and Shinhan Bank that cause their computer network to fail. On an estimated forty-eight thousand computers were infected and their hard drives were wiped out (). The broadcaster companies were able to continue their broadcasting. The banks had trouble with their ATM for a brief time. After this attack, The South Korea launch a full investigation to find out who was behind this attack. Was it an internal attack by an individual act, or was it by another country who want to send a message. Two day later, March 22, 2013 the South Korean was able to trace the IP address belonging to the attacker which traced back to China (). Three days later, March 25, 2013 the Commission told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper that they traced some of the other IP which located in the United States and few of the European countries (). After this the South Korean National Police Agency requested assistance from the United States and three European countries to help them with their investigation in the IP addresses that they found. After a month worth of investigation, on April 20, 2013 the South Korean government announced that the person responsible for the attack was North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau. This was a way for North Korea dictator Kim Jong-Un to show that he is able to attack South Korea any given time because he has at least twelve thousand hackers who are highly skill in encryption and masking on his Bureau. The target audience for this is any government who are not North Korea allies. They need to be ready for when the cyber-attack might hit their country.\n\tIn conclusion, the lesson learned here is cyber-attack can be very powerful if the right person has control and it could be deadly in the wrong hand. The evolution of technologies will only continue to grow. The best solution is we, as the people, need to be more educated with the way technologies work more than just how to power on the device and use it for common purpose. If everyone is aware of the way the computer and how cyber-attack can occur, the nation itself can be help by it citizens to prevent cyber-attack by understand cyber-attack to a certain degree.",

    "Q3": "On December 23, 2015 an event only before depicted in fantastical sci-fi stories became reality. A cyber attack on an Ukraine Power Grid caused the loss of power for approximately 225,000 people. An attack the Ukrainian government officials claim was caused by the Russian security services. This was an unprecedented action in cyber warfare, peaking great concern for the people in Ukraine. Who have had awful relations with Russia for a long time. Only more recently having the annexation of Crimea in March 18, 2014.\nThe attack itself was multifaceted with 6 key attack methods. The first was Spear phishing to gain access to the business networks, this was most likely done before the indecent. Followed by theft of credentials and use of VPN to enter the ICS network and use existing remote access tools. Next variants of malware by the name BlackEnergy 3 implanted at each of the oblenergos, which is believed to have caused the outage itself. Along side the use of a modfied KillDisk to erase the master boot record of impacted organization systems as well as the targeted deletion of some logs. The last two things were done, in my speculation, to delay a response by company to fix the problem. They were using UPS systems to impact connected load with a scheduled service outage and flooding the call center with calls to implement a denial-of-service attack. \nWhile the cost in damages caused by this attack isn't publicly available, we can assume it was a lot of money. For while they retained control after 6 hours, two months after the attack, the control centers are still not fully operational. The lesson learned from this incident is how important having proper security measures in place matter, as well as a plan to tackle such a problem that needs to be assessed and handled immediately. Sadly a year later they were attack again. \n\n\nLee, R., Assante, M., Conway, T. (2016, March 18th). Analysis of the cyber attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid.

Hackers were able to gain access to the email addresses or credit card numbers of 50 million customers who had shopped at Home Depot throughout a few months’ span. The hackers were able to access the data due to a flaw in the security of the store’s self-checkout terminals. The data was left unprotected by a third-party payment processor that hackers could tap into and receive data flowing through the processor.\n\n\tAccording to Fortune Tech article, Home Depot to Pay Banks $25 Million in Data Breach Settlement, this data breach has costs the company “At least $179 million based on the figures in the court documents,” but the author adds this total doesn’t include legal fees and other undisclosed payouts, so the total damages may be even greater. The hackers were not necessarily targeting Home Depot specifically, but saw an opportunity to take advantage of a system that that was not properly protecting vital data.\n\n\tThis disaster was resolved mostly in court as Home Depot was ordered to pay $25 million to the banks effected by the breach, $19.5 million to customers that were effected, and ordered to fix and improve the security of their payment processing systems. This attack shows why it is important to test the security of systems that will be processing critical data. Although the root of the issue was a flaw in a third-party processor, Home Depot is still liable for the damages caused by the breach and could have saved millions by testing the system before implementing it in stores.",

    "Q3": "Ukraine Power Grid Attack, was the first cyber-attack on record of a successful attack on a power grid. The cyber-attack took place on the 23rd of December 2015 and its effects lasted for 6 hours. Proceeding the attack were multiple conflicts in Ukraine from a revolution and the Euromaidan. Another conflict proceeding the attack was the War in Donbass were the Ukrainian forces fought in an armed conflict against the pro-Russian and anti-government forces which were supported by the Russian Federation.  The cyber-attack came from a Russian Federation IP address. the cyber-attack can be broken into three major parts, the reconnaissance, penetration of the system and the execution of the attack.  \nThe reconnaissance for the cyber-attack was suspected from an exploit on android devices allowing them to track Ukrainian artillery units. they also used a technique called spear-phishing where they target three power companies Prykarpattyaoblenergo, Chernivtsioblenergo, and Kyivoblenergo. The spear-phishing these three companies gave them the login credentials to gain access to the Supervisory control and data acquisition also known as SCADA.Once the hackers had access to the SCADA they upload a program known as BlackEnergy2(Willams, 2017) which was used to create a back door to gain further access to the system. With the back door made the hackers escalated privileges to implement the attack on the power grid. The hackers also used KillDisk to destroy the information stored on the servers to increase the recovery time of the power grid.  Than the hackers preformed a denial of service attack on the call centers of the companies to deny consumers from receiving up to date information on the power outage. \nThe total damage of the attack is not reported but the total amount of energy lost is around 73 MWh which affected more than 700,000 residents. This probably had reciprocating effects on many businesses that were also consumers of the electrical companies that had the security breaches. The targeted audience of the attack was all the energy companies in Kiev. The cyber-attack lasted for about 6 hours from the start of the attack to the time that the electrical companies restored the power. The major cause of the delay in restoring the power was killDisk wiped the SCADA including the boot files. To restore the systems the electrical companies had to reinstall everything onto the electrical systems. What we can learn from this is that all systems on the internet are susceptible to cyber-attacks and that it is not just sensitive information that hackers are after. One way this type of attack could have been diminished is by having employees change passwords frequently so that the spear-phishing is not as effective, also not opening any email attachments without first knowing what it is. \n\nWilliams, B.

    "Q3": "The Ukraine power grid attack was a cyber attack carried out by the Russian hacker group known as ‘Fancy Bear’. Fancy is also associated with the alleged Russian attack on the US presidential election. The attack was carried out by sending a large amount of emails with malware in them to employees that worked in the Ukraine power grid. The hackers ended up gaining control over some key systems and managed to shut down roughly 20 percent of Kiev’s power. \nThe reason such an attack most likely took place was at the behest of the Russian government, or the hacker group known as Fancy Bear has goals that are in line with the Russian high command. The reason for this assumption is because of Fancy Bears previous attack on DNC’s email servers. That combined with their attack on the Ukraine power grid has lead many people to assuming they work for or alongside the Russian government. Ukraine is an obvious target for a Russian allied group as the nation has the Crimea region already annexed by Russia. \nThe targeted audience for this attack is no doubt the Ukrainian people. Such an attack seeks to sow discord and chaos amongst the Ukrainian people in order to undermine the position of the Ukrainian government. This attack also serves as a warning not only to the government of Ukraine, but to any enemies of Russia. The US may think themselves immune to such an attack but there is nothing stopping an attack on a much higher level from taking place against an American power grid. This means other countries, and especially the US needs to take precautions against malicious hacking attempts on their key facilities, especially power and energy facilities which are especially vulnerable to these types of assaults. \n\nCitation:\n\nCondliffe, J.

A logic bomb is a malicious piece of code that is purposefully inserted into a computer system and is triggered when a specific set of conditions are met. For example, a logic bomb can be programmed to be set off at a certain time or when specific keystrokes are entered. A hacker or person with ill-intent can disguise the logic bomb as software or a phishing email. The logic bomb would then insert itself when the software is executed or email is opened. A piece of software that hides malware is also known as a Trojan horse. Logic bombs can be dormant in a computer system for years, so it is very difficult to know if you have one. \nA reputable logic bomb attack would be the 2013 logic bomb attack in South Korea. At 2pm on the day of March 20th, 2013, the logic bomb targeted at least three South Korean banks and two media companies simultaneously and wiped the hard drives of the infected computer systems (Zetter 2013). This created serious drawbacks. Banks need to run so that they can make financial decisions, some of these decisions are worth millions of dollars. A few hours of downtime can exponentially increase that cost. There was no official mention of actual damages but our coverage on downtime in class leads me to believe it was substantial. Also some ATM’s were down, preventing South Koreans from accessing their money (Zetter 2013). If banks are down and money cannot be accessed, customers get outraged because they cannot pay bills, buy food etc. On top of that the banks may not be able to regain public trust, a cost that is not tangible. Author Kim Zetter states in her article that on March 19th, the security firm Trend Micro noticed a phishing email that was sent to South Korean organizations and that those emails contained a Trojan.  Cyber-attacks are commonly done through phishing, so it is not surprising that it could have caused the insertion of the logic bomb.\nThere are many ways that firms can protect or recover themselves from logic bombs. That being said, “Logic bombs are difficult to prevent because they can be deployed from almost anywhere” (Armendariz 2016). Also an attacker can use many different methods of planting logic bombs. The ways firms can protect themselves are not downloading pirated software, be careful with installing software, be cautious when operating email attachments, do not click on suspicious web links, always update your antivirus software, install the software/OS patches and have a back-up plan (Armendariz 2016). Taking the extra step in doing these can make the difference in a firm shutting down or continuing operations. These procedures will help but as we learned in class, having a recovery plan is essential to reducing downtime.\nThis information provided is not limited to just firms. The targeted audience would be firms, technical professionals, and the average person. This helps spread awareness of this type of attack. As we have seen, logic bombs can cause significant disruption to businesses and people. We should learn from others mistakes and take the initiative to follow the procedures previously stated in order to protect our information and property, before it’s too late.\n\t\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\nZetter, K.

On April 15, 2015, a security engineer named Brendan Saulsbury was decrypting a part of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) traffic that flow across the OPM’s network. Hackers have been learning to use SSL to camouflage their activities and OPM was looking into securing their network. Saulsbury had found a signal that led to a domain that the OPM didn’t have called opmsecurity.org. Saulsbury and his colleagues looked further into this using a program called Cylance V and found the source of the signal which was call mcutil.dll which was a component of software that McAfee sold. Saulsbury and his colleagues found that it had malware that would allow hackers into OPM’s network. \nThe creation of opmsecurity.org was registered on April 25, 2014 and the domains owner was “Steve Rogers” which is believed to be used by hackers, who use Avenger themed names to register sites, which cause some devastating attacks. The attack was most likely an advanced persistent threat (APT) which is a well-financed and usually state sponsored group of hackers. The OPM would need to look into what was stolen, but would have to go through and find the malware in their networks by looking through 15,000 machines. The hackers took background-check data which OPM’s digital archives had over 18 million copies of Standard Form 86 which contains some personal information on applicants. The hackers next got the personnel information of 4.2 million employees, both past and present and got 5.6 million digital images of government employee fingerprints. The intentions of the hackers or who they could possibly be working for remains unknown.   \nMichael Daniels, a white house cybersecurity coordinator, and Tony Scott, the US Federal CIO, would develop policy goals that would help change the federal governments approach to cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity National Action Plan was developed from the OPM breach and had input from the Pentagon and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This document would allow billions to be used for important projects such as upgrading outmoded systems.\nThe target audience for the OPM breach are those looking to see how a lack of up to date security can cause problems in the future. The lessons learned from the breach is taking the necessary precautions to help secure data, but knowing how to deal with situations when there is a breach is also important. The breach also shows how important it is to have a system to deal with cybersecurity to prevent future attacks.\nBibliography\nKoerner, Brendan I. (2016, October 23).

Target noticed a fraud in transactions that involved credit cards being compromised by credit card processors. It is not clear as to how exactly the attack was carried out, whether it was that hackers found a weakness on the network or through credit card service vendors. However, their online store was not affected by this matter.

The targeted audience of this article is for consumers or shoppers who use credit or debit cards as their form of payment. The resolution for the article is to clearly be firm of how the breach occurred, because not many of the consumers knew exactly how it happened and as a loyal shopper, it is only right for them to know.

I would like by first defining what a logic bomb is, it is defined as a destructive computer program that is inactive until it is triggered by an event taking place on the computer. They are also commonly referred to as time bombs, because of the way they wait either until a certain time or when a trigger is activated. In this attack, a logic bomb went off in South Korea that affected a few banks and broadcasting companies. The logic bomb was programed to go off at a specific time on a certain day, and once the time came around, the logic bomb went to work. \nThe logic bomb affected the bank’s computers as well as a few broadcasting companies systems.The damage done by the logic bomb was nothing that could not be fixed. As one could imagine, all of the computers were offline, but once they came back on, users were prompted to download an operating system as if the computer was brand new.

According to Condliffe (2016), the hackers were able to take out about 200 megawatts worth of power which is almost one fifth of the city’s power. Even though the blackout lasted only for about an hour, this was the second time Ukraine had been hit by a major blackout, the first of which taking place in 2015 resulting in the loss of power to around 225,000 people, as well as leaving some of the affected control centers still not fully operational months after the attack (Zetter, 2016).\nThe attack was well orchestrated and took months in advance of planning to accomplish. According to agencies like the FBI, the hackers sent phishing malware in the form of a word document that was open to open a backdoor into infected computers by enabling macros (Zetter, 2016). Once in the system, they were able to harvest the credentials of workers and gain direct access to the power grid. This allowed them to scope out the layout of each individual substation. With this useful information in hand they were able to rewrite the firmware needed in order to access remote commands from outside the network, they also sabotaged the uninterruptible power supply for the power stations, rendering the customers in the dark and the operators forced to manually operate the breakers for each substation. After all of this, the hackers used a device called a KillDisk to remotely wipe any trace of their work (Zetter, 2016).\nThis is not the first time Ukraine’s power system has been hacked and it is believed that Russia was responsible for the attacks. Although there is no direct proof that Russia has had any involvement in the attack Ukraine authorities have since blamed Russia. Relations have been shaky since 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and began taking Ukrainian energy companies (Zetter, 2016). This has led to high tensions amongst the Russians and Ukrainians, therefore it is a reasonable assumption.\nAlthough the attack did not cause substantial damages, it had the potential to be way worse than what it was, and it seems as almost as a warning of some sort. The hackers had the potential to physically destroy substation equipment had they wanted to. Robert M. Lee, co-founder of Dragos Security, who assisted in the investigation said that the details of the attack suggest that someone was sending a message to Ukraine (Zetter, 2016). This time there was nothing to worry about, but next time might not be the same.\n\nCitation\nCondliffe, J. (2016, December 22).

There are many cyber crimes occurring every day the range form small crimes to very large crimes. On March 20, 2013 South Korea was struck by a large cyber attack called a logic bomb. Logic bombs are small programs which can be triggered by a specific event, date and time. (Northcutt,2014). This logic bomb that dictated that on March 20, 2013 at 2pm local time the malware began erasing data from the machines. The attack wiped the hard drives and the master boot record of at least three banks and two media companies (Zetter, 2013). \n\nThere were four files use to complete this attack. The file which triggered the wiping was called AgentBase.exe. AgentBase.exe had a hex strange which indicated the date and time the attack to begin. A minute after the time all the hard drive and master boot record on the windows machines were overwritten (Zetter, 2013). The biggest lessons these companies learned is to be careful with the emails they open because this attacked first started from a phishing email the following day. Therefore if they did not open the email the malware would never have been placed on their system.",

    "Q3": "A logic bomb, also known as a slag code, is a programming code, inserted surreptitiously or intentionally into a software system and is designed to set off malicious functions after a certain amount of time has passed or when program conditions are met. Logic bombs can be used in a variety of ways. They can be embedded into a Trojan horse, which is a malicious computer program used to hack into a computer network by misleading users into thinking that the program is legitimate. If a logic bomb code is embedded into the Trojan horse, then will execute when the user launches the fake software. Attackers also use logic bombs with other spyware to steal one’s identity. \n\tAlthough many logic bombs have been programmed to execute within numerous organizations and networks over the last decade, in recent years there are a few successful prolific attacks. One of which includes the logic bomb attack against South Korea that was set off on March 20, 2013. According to security firm Trend Micro, the first signs of a possible attack were made on March 19, when South Korean organizations receipted spam messages that included a malicious attachment. By the next day, the actual attack commenced. This logic bomb cyberattacks wiped the hard drives of over 30,000 computers belonging to banks and broadcasting companies in South Korea. The attack took several ATMs across the country out of operation, preventing South Koreans from withdrawing any cash from them. The malware behind the attack consisted of four files, one called AgentBase.exe that triggered the wiping. Within that file was a hex string (4DAD4678), which indicated the date and time the attack would begin. In this attack, the execution was set on March 20, 2013, at 2pm local time. Once the time was reached, the wiper began to overwrite the hard drive and master boot record on Windows operating machines and rebooted the system. According to Symantec Corporation, the malware also contained components made for deleting date from Linux machines, by searching for connections and using any stored credentials to access Linux servers, wiping their records.  Citing data from South Korea’s defense ministry, representative Chung Hee-soo, states that the cyber-attack that started on March 20 and ended on June 25 caused about 470 million euros, which is equivalent to over 512 million dollars to resolve the issue. \n\tThe Korea Communications Commission reported that they traced the malware to a Chinese IP address that was used to attack servers of numerous organizations. However, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense argued that it cannot rule out the possibility that North Korea was involved in the attack because the logic bomb attack occurred amid increasing tensions after North Korea accused South Korea and the United States of plotting cyber-attacks against the North Korea. On April 10, 2013, the South Korean government identified that the culprit of the attack was linked to North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau. With that be said, the target audience of the 2013 logic bomb attack on South Korea should be everyone or everything from businesses to federal agencies and even individuals. Anyone can become a victim of a malicious logic bomb attack when they least expect it. Businesses and individuals everywhere, myself included, can learn from this malicious attack. Logic bombs are difficult to prevent because they can be deployed anywhere. Organizations everywhere if not doing so already, should include recovery plans such as data backups and recovery in case they fall victim to an attack that wipes out their data and turn to the separation of duties because it would deter hackers from executing a logic bomb within a system. Log monitoring would identify if any malicious software or changes were brought upon the system, this limiting the ability of attackers to implement a change such as embed malicious codes. \n\tLogic bombs can be implemented on any system. Organizations should remain on high alert and log changes within their system to identify if they are possibly being attacked. However, just as security improves over the years, so do the ways hacker execute cyber attacks. Logic bombs can be costly; therefore, businesses and organizations everywhere should learn from this attack and strengthen their own security to prevent being a victim of such attacks.",

Home Depot offered free credit services to those who may have been affected and apologized for the data breach. \n\tDuring breaches like this payment card information can be sold by cyber criminals. In more recent retail breaches, cyber criminals have been able to steal payment card information from millions of customers nationwide and sell it online on what is known as the “Darknet”. The attackers were able to gain access to one of Home Depot’s vendor environments by using a third-party vendor’s login credentials. They then exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Windows, which allowed them to pivot from the vendor-specific environment to the Home Depot corporate environment. Once the attackers were in the Home Depot network, they installed memory scraping malware on over 7500 self-checkout POS terminals (Hawkins 2017). The payment card information was then sold and the email addresses were helpful in large phishing campaigns. The audience that was targeted was random customers that were making purchases during that time period using the self-checkout POS. The attacker was only interested in payment card information and email addresses. Home Depot could have had in place several countermeasures to prevent the breach from happening in the first place. They had no regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning of POS environment. They also did not have proper network segregation between the Home Depot corporate network and POS network. Another control they lacked was proper monitoring capabilities and management of third-party vendor identities and access. Furthermore, a point to point encryption would help future situations that are similar to this. \n\tIn conclusion, Home Depot did not anticipate such an attack and because they did not expect this they were not prepared for the consequences when such an attack did happen. From this all retailers and business can learn that routine scanning and maintenance of the business’s system and network is highly necessary and can compromise the company millions of dollars and cause a lot of harm to customers and their personal information.\n\n \n\nHawkins, B.

In December 2013, hackers successfully breached Target’s sensitive database. They were now able to use this data to impersonate and overall profit off about 70 million people in their database, not to mention the 40 million credit and debit cards that had also been compromised. The hackers also compromised numerous REDcards, Target’s loyalty card. This breach put a spotlight on how companies secure our data and how easy it is for hackers to breach the company’s customers put their trust in with their information. \n\tThe thing that makes the Target breach a nightmare is that Target, like any business in its realm, keeps data about your spending habits and trends in their databases. Based off these spending habits and trends, they make a profile of the customer and send them ads targeting their specific needs or wants to make the business to customer relationship seem more personal. In the wrong hands, it would make the customers whose information was compromised more susceptible to fraudulent ads and other scams because they now seem believable. The hackers could also just use their information to buy stuff that fits in the person’s profile so it’s harder to distinguish which purchases were made by the victim and which ones were made by the hacker. \nTarget had a rough time trying to mitigate and resolve the damages left from the attack, especially since they didn’t tell what exactly happened. “The growing scandal has triggered at least two class-action lawsuits, drawn state and federal investigations, and damaged Target’s bottom line” (The Washington Post).  They tried mending customer relationships by providing one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Card companies like Chase and American Express were also affected by the hacking and were forced to issue out new cards for their customers that were impacted as well. Even with their 10% off sale after the attack to try to save customers, their stock and sales dropped significantly. \nThe Target breach of 2013 highlighted a plethora of tips every company should know. When your systems get hacked, the best thing you can do for your company is to quickly come out to the media and admit that you’ve been hacked. Your customers may not like to hear the news but the quicker people know their information has been compromised, the less damage that news brings on the company and other indirect companies involved. Also, keeping the customers posted on what is going on in the investigation is very important because it shows that, although your systems were hacked, you are still a trustworthy company because you are diligently trying to make up for the damage that’s been made. Yes, your company will probably still suffer a loss in sales initially but over time your customers will begin to trust you again. \n\n\t APA Citations:\n\nJayakumar, Amrita & Yang, Jia Lynn.

Prior to the attack, Iran was in civil unrest as people protested and rioted in the streets because they didn’t believe the results of the election that reelected the incumbent president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Stuxnet terrorized the program in parts and went undetectable for about a year. It damaged over 900 centrifuges(Zetter) within the year slowing down the program just enough so that they could never see it come to fruition as the number of centrifuges being destroyed kept increasing. \n\tIn conclusion, the Iranian nuclear program never had a chance to complete their purpose of nuclear weapons due to the success of Stuxnet. The Iranians continued the program but to no avail as they never got to amass enough uranium to complete the nuclear weapon. Stuxnet hit the program where it hurts by destroying equipment and delaying the project immensely. The power of cyberattacks are not to be dealt with lightly as they can damage an operation for long periods of time if you do not find the malicious files fast enough. Stuxnet will forever be known as the cyber weapon that put a hindrance on the Iranian nuclear program protecting us from a more nuclear future. \nSources\n1.\tZetter, K. (2014, November 03).

    "Q3": "Nick Tsang\nApril 26, 2017\nIS 300 Section 3\nProfessor Everhart\nThe Snake in the Digital Garden\n\tThe case study I decided to write about is the ‘Stuxnet’ worm which according to Kushner (2013) “it infected the software for over 14 industrial sites in Iran, some of which that included uranium plants. Then once the worm is it would target Windows OS, then it will look for Siemens Step7, which would give the author of Stuxnet control over the plants’ centrifuges to tear themselves apart and essential cause major nuclear explosions. Although there are no confirmed destroyed centrifuges that is reported from Iran.” (The Real Story of Stuxnet, para. 2-3). Now this isn’t the first cyber-attack. It was just the first cyber-attack that had the goal of a politically motivated attack. Obtaining the title from some media outlets as one of the first digital warfare weapons.\n\tAccording to Kushner (2013) “One of the senior computer security researchers, Schouwenberg, and his colleague had analyzed the worm, admiring the work, but they had soon realized that the worm was far too sophisticated for some random group of hackers to create. The worm was the first of its kind to be able to perform four zero-day exploits and attack every possible vulnerability there may in any system immediately.” (The Real Story of Stuxnet, para.16-17) So then it had become clear that the culprits could’ve been another agency trying to cause political ramifications between countries by causing the uranium plants in Iran to tear apart. Over time more and more updated and larger filed versions of the Stuxnet worm were coming out. According to Kushner (2013) “A variant known as Daqu that was meant to steal information about industrial control systems. And then there was Flame was the next big Stuxnet variant that was meant to send information directly to the creator’s servers and essentially spy on people. The worry some method of how Flame got on people’s computers was by going through a Windows update, unbeknownst to the users or Microsoft.” (The Real Story of Stuxnet, para.21-23). But as time went on, it became easier for major companies to figure out the Stuxnet code by reverse engineering the code. Thus, making the hack obsolete and preventing it from achieving the main goal of politically damaging the trust between countries. Now these days the hack is used for personal gain from time to time but more as a prank than anything else. And these days companies hire and invest more into virus and malware protection than they did before.\n\tSo in the end, the one major thing gained out of this incident would have to be the fact that cyber security had adapted to the attack and are now more equipped and prepared for future attacks. And there wasn’t any confirmed major issues that caused much damage to major corporations, so the crisis here has somewhat been more of an incident that helped create a stronger security from cyber attacks.\n\t\nCitation\nKushner, D.

    "Q3": "Stuxnet is defined as a computer worm that targets industrial control systems that are used to monitor and control large scale industrial facilities like power plants, dams, waste processing systems and similar operations. It allows the attackers to take control of these systems without the operators knowing. This is the first attack we’ve seen that allows hackers to manipulate real-world equipment, which makes it very dangerous. The worm is like nothing ever seen before. This is into aspects, both in the way game to exist and what it does. It is known as the first computer virus to be able to wreak chaos in the actual world. it is a very well adapting and sophisticated virus. There are not many groups known that could successfully and act this kind of thread. Stuxnet is known as the first cyber-attack to be specifically targeting industrial control systems. Many people question what language the code for the worm is. The Stuxnet virus was written in multiple languages, including C, C++, and a few other object oriented languages. Not much is distinctly known, but this was found out through reverse engineering. They also predicted it works by the worm inserting itself between the PC used to monitor the Natanz “centrifuge array” and “the target centrifuge array”. Then “A classic 'man in the middle' attack. Stuxnet injects Siemens PCS7 language malware into motor controllers to control the target centrifuge controllers. While the attacks are in process Stuxnet 'plays back' normal readings to the Siemens monitor software running on Windows.” Since there is not a lot known, no one knows the exact price of the damages that it caused. But in a hypothetical case, the University of Cambridge stated that the financial damage would be anywhere from US $243 billion and up to US $1 trillion in immediate and tangential economic loss.  I believe that the intended audience are those who are interested in coding and cyber security. Not only is the virus a very interesting topic, because there's so much of discrepancy with it, many theories have come from it. There is no documented resolution to the problem. The virus stopped on a specific date. It stop spreading on June 24th, 2012. This date was coded deep inside of one of its configuration blocks. It was the date that the LNK replication sub-routines stopped working and the worm stocked infecting USB memory sticks. The lesson I learned from this, is that the we have advanced far in the field of cyber security there are still some things that we do not know how to solve. This virus was never stopped. It was coded to stop on it own. This brings the question to mind, what would happen if the code was not set to stop working on that date.\n\nCostin Raiu on June 25, 2012. 6:57 pm. (2012, June 25).

Businesses which use MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) systems are at risk of black hole attacks because the systems are usually autonomous and have wireless insecure connections. Given that the communication between the nodes is not very secure, it is vulnerable to black hole attacks. \nIn December of 2016, Paunch who is the accused author of the Black Hole exploit kit in Russia was arrested.

    "Q3": "A SQL injection is when a hacker enters in a piece of malicious SQL (standard query language) code into a form field with the intent on gaining access or causing damage to a database. Here’s how it happens: The hacker identifies a vulnerability in a website. They then exploit that vulnerability entering a piece of SQL code into a form field. The website then reads string and instead of interpreting it as a username or password reads it as SQL code and then executes it. SQL injections disproportionately target retail and financial institutions. Hackers will target these institutions so they can gain access to sensitive financial information such as customer’s credit cards. In the early 2000’s Albert Gonzalez was arrested for gaining access to over 180 million payment cards through retailers like Target, Barnes & Nobles, BJ’s and more (Verni, 2010). While SQL injections can cause a lot of damage the good news is that they are very preventable. Hackers can only perform SQL injections if there is a vulnerability to be exploited. By checking and filtering all user input, using strong encryption and authorization as well as secure coding companies can limit their exposure to possible SQL injection attacks. \n\n Verni, J (2010, November 10).

    "Q3": "One cyber-attack that stood out to me was the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). This attack is described as an attack by a hacker that denies information or service to authorized users on a network. The hacker will target a computer and its network connection to prevent one from accessing the information that they are trying to reach, such as online account information, email, or other web applications. The attacker can use your computer to attack other computers by taking control of your computer and flooding the other computer with requests, more requests than their computer can handle. This is considered to be distributed because the hacker is using multiple computers in their attack (McDowell). Businesses that are most likely to come under attack by this type of attack are companies that host a domain name system (DNS) because if this company is flooded with seemingly legitimate requests from the hacker and goes down, then all of the sites that it is hosting will go down as well. A recent example of this was in October 2016 when Dyn, a business that hosts DNS for a number of sites such as Netflix, Twitter, Amazon, and Spotify, was down due to a DDoS attack on their servers (Weise). Some ways to prevent this type of attack from happening to you are to “install and maintain anti-virus software…Install a firewall, and configure it to restrict traffic coming into and leaving your computer [or network]…Follow good security practices for distributing your email addresses. Applying email filters may help discourage unwanted traffic” (McDowell). It is sometimes hard to distinguish if your computer is assisting in an attack, but there are some indicators such as, inability or unavailability of websites or uncharacteristically slow network performance (McDowell). While these types of attacks are not common to individual users, hackers do not discriminate with who they attack so it is important to remain informed about DDoS attacks and how to prevent them.\n\nWorks Cited\nMcDowell, M.

    "Q3": "Phishing a form of a cyber attack in which someone tries to obtain sensitive and personal information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details for malicious reasons by disguising as themselves as a trustworthy company or online communication. There are three types of phishing attacks, spear phishing,whaling phishing and vishing phishing. Spear phishing targets a specific group to attack, while whaling phishing attacks senior or high level executives. These two types of phishing types are most commonly used when attacking companies. Online businesses are most likely to fall victim to phishing attacks because users access these stores online and that is where phishing takes place. A recent case of spear phishing happened with the famous online company that helps users store their pictures online, Dropbox. There was an email sent out claiming to be from dropbox but it was really from a student attending Berkeley university. Once the user clicked the dropbox link displayed in the email they  were required to enter their login information. In order to combat these kinds of attacks, it is important to survey the page and make sure the email is being sent from the company's domain, and not a random email. Another incident of a phishing attack happened earlier this year at Berkeley university, when students were sent an email that was supposed to contain a W-2 document for faxes. However when the students opened the email they were being asked for their usernames and passwords.

    "Q3": "The type of attack that I am writing about is the locky virus. This type of attack is has many different distribution methods but is usually delivered by email with a link inside the email or an attached Microsoft Word or Excel document that contains malicious macros. The email looks like it is coming from a legitimate source, but is actually attackers disguising themselves so that they can send the locky virus. When the user opens the document or email link, it appears to be full of nonsense so they use a social engineering technique such as including the phrase “Enable macro if data encoding is incorrect,” to trick the user into enabling macros on their computer (Ducklin, 2016). If the user does enable macros, they then save and run a binary file that downloads the virus which will encrypt all files that match the .locky file extension. These attackers apply the .locky file extension to all files which then scrambles and renames those files. After the encryption a message displayed on the user’s desktop instructs them to download the Tor browser and visit a specific criminal-operated web site for further information. The web site contains instructions that demand a payment of between 0.5 and 1 bitcoin. Since the criminals possess the private key and the remote servers are controlled by them, the victims are motivated to pay to decrypt their files (Ducklin, 2016).\n\tAnybody could be a victim of the locky virus, according to Jonathan Crowe, attacks and ransom demands are up and nearly fifty percent of organizations have been hit with this virus. With every new Bitcoin payment deposited to these attackers, a new incentive arises for them to improve their technology and techniques. In March 2016 there were 56,000 ransomware infections, in the first quarter of 2016 $209 million dollars was paid to ransomware criminals, and the average ransom demand has more than doubled going from $294 in 2015 to $679 in 2016 (Crowe, n.d). This large increase in the average has partly to do with the $17,000 ransomware attack on Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. This notable incident happened in February 2016; the hospital was infected by the delivery of an email attachment disguised as a Microsoft Word invoice. This prevented hospital staff from being able to communicate, get patient information, and carry out other necessary duties. The hospital’s CEO, Allen Stefanek, said that the quickest and most efficient way to restore the systems and administrative functions was to pay the 40 bitcoin ($17,000) ransom and obtain the decryption key (Winton, 2016). The hospital alerted authorities and was able to regain control of all it computer systems. Since then the FBI has taken over the investigation. \n\tThe best thing to do to prevent being infected by the locky virus is to be suspicious and aware. If you encounter a suspicious email or document, do not open it and especially do not download anything from it. Don’t enable macros in document attachments or links received via email. Criminals are relying on the dilemma that you shouldn’t open a document until you are sure it’s one you want, but you can’t tell if it’s one you want until you open it. If in doubt, leave it out (Ducklin, 2016). Another way is the install the Microsoft Office viewer applications which let you see what documents look like without actually opening them. If you do happen to fall victim of the locky virus, there are security programs that will remove it for you.\n\nDucklin, P. (2016, March 01). “Locky” ransomware – what you need to know.

    "Q3": "Botnets are interconnected networks of computers festered by malware, without the possessor's knowledge. The goal of the malware is to send spam and steal the user’s data. Users receive emails with attachments, which contain the virus.  The virus enters the system and gives access to the hacker, which creates the botnet and allows the hacker to connect with other computers. Botnets are used during Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) in order to send spam and viruses, steal personal information such as banking info, and gain control of websites.\nSince botnets can gain access to important banking information they are targeted towards any online user. They are known to target users through popular social media sites such as Twitter and Reddit as well as IoT devices, which is also known as the mirai botnet. Mirai botnets can cause attacks through household devices connected to the Internet such as music players and DVR’s.\nOn October 21st sites such as Netflix, Reddit, Twitter, and CNN were shut down due to Mirai botnet attacks on the well-known server, Dyn. These attacks are known to be massive since there are plenty of IoT devices available. This attack has caused cyber security groups to take extra precautions. Within the last month, Ikea has recently produced a light bulb that can be controlled through the user’s smartphone.  Cyber security groups are skeptical about this invention as it could create another massive mirai attack similar to the one in October. \nThere are multiple ways to avoid a botnet attack. A major key in preventing any type of cyber attack is being cautious with where you input your personal information and limit how often you use it online.  Installing an anti virus software and checking the security settings also play a huge role in dodging a cyber attack. The final tip is to make sure the source of an email or attachment is known before clicking on it. If the source is unknown the attachment could be a virus. Being a cautious user can help prevent cyber attackers from receiving personal information.\n\nCitation\n  Norton by Symantec. Bots and botnets—a growing threat.

Typically, businesses that use rely on online services are at a higher risk. In 2016, the internet performance management company Dyn suffered downtime due to a DDoS attack. The attackers exploited the vulnerability of the DNS vendor to takedown multiple online services such as Twitter, Netflix, and Slack. DNS's can be compromised by covertly building botnets behind them or installing hidden malware. This means that DNS vendors should be a top priority when it comes to DDoS protection. Today DDoS attacks range from 1 Gbps to 600 Gbps. Because of this, there isn’t a much that can be done to avoid a large-scale DDoS attack. One way to minimize the damage after a large DDoS attack is by using software-defined networking (SDN) systems.

One of the topics I chose from the informative presentations is: Phishing. Phishing may sound fun as it has a different prefix, but the actual activity ‘fishing’ is what most people should find more amusing. Phishing is when someone is making an attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, often for malicious reasons by disguising as a trustworthy individual via an electronic communication. \n\tThe types of businesses that most likely encounter phishing is all organizations, well-known corporations, small businesses, and even individuals. I, myself almost fell for a phishing scam. It was an email that looked exactly similar to a PayPal email. It stated that I promptly changed my password as PayPal is currently updating their website for security reasons. My first instinct was that I needed to change it as soon as possible. I clicked on the link and it had taken me to a PayPal website (it looked so alike to the actual PayPal website!) which then required to enter my information (e-mail and previous password), but there was not a confirmation afterwards. I was very confused. As I began getting worried, I went to check my primary email and no confirmation notification appeared so I quickly went to my PayPal account and changed all my information. I checked thoroughly through all my transactions (past and present), making sure no one used my card(s) in my account. It was a huge lesson learn for myself that I vowed to not click on a link that seem suspicious. I was not able to send a report to PayPal in order for them to inform if it was phishing or not because I was still doubtful. I am just relieved I changed my password. \n\tThere are quite many phishing scams out there, but one in particular is very important to be informed about is Google’s Gmail because many students use Gmail for school, personal, and work-related things. Gmail phishing scam has been going on for quite some time now. The phisher sends an email with an attachment such as a Word document or PDF. Prior on clicking the attachment, Gmail users are redirected to the Google sign-in page prompting them to enter their information. No one wants to be trapped in a phisher’s net. It can be very difficult sometimes to figure if it is a phishing scam because logos of the company are exactly the same and the logos are in the same position as the real website. To detect that the email is in fact a phishing scam is by looking at the address bar. For instance, “Instead of a standard URL like \"https://\" the page actually masks a data URI that starts with \"data:text/htyml.” (Tech Times)\nAlthough, “Google has updated its Chrome browser to warn against fake sign-in forms such as this one, it doesn't stop the phishing scam altogether. It just shows a \"Not Secure\" message in the address bar of the page, and some users might not even spot it.” (Tech Times) As a tip, if you notice the “Not Secure” warning in the address bar, close the tab.\n\t\nCitation:\n\nBurlacu, A.

Students discussed the Black Hole Attack, Logic Bomb, Phone Phishing (Interactive Voice Response - IVR), SQL Injection, Phishing, Botnets, Man in the Middle, DDoS, Virus and Password Attacks. I will be going further into detail about the Phishing attack. Phishing is a common method of online identity theft and virus spreading. The Phishing attack is a form of social engineering attempt to trick users to click a link or open an attachment. Phishing is performed through email, phone, or VOIP. Phishers attempt to steal personal and financial data. They also infect computers with viruses and convince people to participate in money laundering. The best way to avoid being a victim of phishing is to be suspicious of everything and to educate yourself on phishing. \nThere are many different type of phishing. The different types of phishing are: spear, clone, whaling, link manipulation, filter evasion, filter evasion, website forgery, covert redirect, phone, and tab nabbing. Another type of phishing is the homograph attack. It is when attackers create different language character sets to produce URLs that look like authentic ones. An example of phishing is when an email message or phone call states that you are receiving it due to suspicious activity on your account, and asking you to \"click here\" to verify your information. Another example is when a “victim visits the phishing website, the deception is not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to alter the address bar. This is done either by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.”\nThere are different techniques to avoid phishing. An example is anti-phishing. There are websites that publish messages that have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. These websites provide details about the particular messages. Businesses have been using anti-phishing to protect their personal information. Phishing can be reported to authorities if you are a victim of it. If you are a victim to phishing you can report it to phishing@iu.edu and report it to the Federal Trade Commission. Another way to avoid phishing includes the deployment of appropriate strategies against computer viruses, spyware and spams. This implies that having application programs that can help in the detection of malware and prevent their automatic installation and execution plays an integral role in combating phishing. In addition, antivirus and antispyware programs must be installed with updated signatures so that they can identify new releases of spyware programs (Miller & Vandome, 2009).\nThe types of businesses that were/are more likely to be victims are/were healthcare companies and online shoppers. “Wombat Security compiled data from the “millions of phishing attacks sent through the ThreatSim and Wombat platforms” from Oct. 1, 2014 through Sept. 30, 2015, according to the company’s 2016 State of the Phish report, released on Tuesday. Nearly 25% of polled organizations belonged to the finance industry, followed by “other,” manufacturing and healthcare, each with between 10% and 15%. The company also sent a survey to its database of security professionals including both customers and non-customers and received hundreds of responses.” Being aware of phishing and other cybercrime is very essential. Attackers do not resist and will try to get their hands on any information that they can.\t\nWork Cited\n85% of polled companies victims of phishing scams in 2015, a 13% increase from 2014: Wombat Security.

These attacks are typically used to gain important information from companies, banks, news sites, or even video game servers. Major companies such as Twitter or Tumblr have been targets of DDoS attacks, leaving users temporarily unable to use any of the company's online services. Fortunately, nothing major was compromised during the attacks. Using simple scripts to monitor network traffic can be beneficial in detecting an attack before it occurs. The script will notify the programmer if traffic is unusually high, and they can begin to take precautionary measures to defend against the potential attack.\n\nArbor Networks. (n.d.).

A DDoS attack typically compromises hundreds of computer systems available on the internet. It denies target service “by sending the redundant stream of packets to a victim rendering it unavailable to legitimate clients” (Behal, Kumar, p1, 2017). \nDDoS attacks are categorized into high-rate and low-rate. High-rate DDoS attacks occur when the traffic rate is significantly different from the legitimate traffic. Low-rate DDoS attacks occur when traffic rate is similar or less than the legitimate traffic. Because high-rate DDoS attacks are easy to detect, sophisticated attackers lean towards low-rate attacks which are more subtle.\nDDoS attacks are a threat to all web services. Prominent websites are often the prime victims (Behal, Kumar, 2017). This also includes any businesses that offer online shopping. \nA recent incident of a DDoS attack was on October 21, 2016 when Twitter, Spotify and Amazon experienced interruptions in their services for about two hours. The interruptions led to an intense revenue loss of $209 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to only $24 million for all of 2015. Per the Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR), the volume of DDoS attacks escalated to around 600 Gbps in 2016. \nThe two types of DDoS attack detection methods are the signature-based detection method and the anomaly-based detection method. The signature-based method recognizes a known pattern with the pattern of incoming packets. It works based on stored attack signatures from the past. Signature-based detection requires updated signatures for efficiency. On the other hand, the anomaly-based detection method compares the pre-built network behavior model with the incoming network behavior in real-time. The limitations of an anomaly-based detection are (a) attackers can monitor the network traffic, (b) there is a change of a false positive rate when setting up an optimal threshold, and (c) it is hard to extract qualitative and precise features of a legitimate and anomalous network behavior. \n\nBehal, S., Kumar, K.

    "Q3": "Phishing is a type of attack in which a person uses social engineering to trick end users to click on a lick or attachment to collect their personal data. This personal data is then sold to others or used to try and get into the person’s various accounts. Social Engineering is a form of engineering in which a person cons another person, in other words the malicious actor tricks the user into giving their personal information without them even realizing they are putting themselves in danger. A common occurrence are malicious actors asking general questions in which they determine a user’s security questions, the questions on websites such as “What elementary school did you attend?” or “What is your mother’s maiden name?” These questions can be used to retrieve a user’s password without them even knowing about it at all. \nBesides the social engineering aspect of just talking or asking the person via voice or email for the information, they can also get the information from malware. This malware can be sent to the user in an email attachment or a link. When the user clicks on the link or downloads the attachment, malware can be put onto the user’s system which can collect the users personal information and send it back to the malicious actor. Malware can collect more than data however, it can even be put on user’s computers to record their keystrokes in what is known as a key logger, or other various types of attacks.\nPhishing attacks mostly target individuals, as they are the most vulnerable to being tricked. Individuals are the ones who can open the attachment or click the link in the email, they are also the ones who can be social engineered to give up information without even realizing it. Even though the individual or the user has no intention of being a malicious actor, they are tricked into letting malware onto their own, or a company’s systems. Even though phishing attacks may target individuals, their end goals could certainly be the business the person works for since they could be a weak link within the business compared to the security the business may have set up.\nA recent attack happened in 2016 to United Services Automobile Association (USAA) members in which members were receiving spam emails that were socially engineered to seem like it was the USAA asking for personal information. In the email, they make sure to state that they are asking for this information to keep their account inaccessible by unauthorized personnel. However, the people sending this email were phishing this information from them to gain control of their accounts, and quite possibly other various accounts these people had access to (Olenick, 2016).\nWays to keep yourself safe from phishing attacks are hard as most seem like they are legitimate or real. That’s the whole purpose of the attack, to trick users into thinking they are safe and therefore people will give their information away. The safest thing to do against phishing attacks is to be as paranoid or skeptical as possible when people ask for personal information. Keep your personal information as safe as possible online. Read any email that asks for personal information or for you to download an attachment very carefully and note who the sender is. Maybe even email the sender back to ask them for confirmation or maybe if in a work environment visit their office or cubicle to make sure it’s from them. Always take everything you see online with a grain of salt and be very careful not to give yourself away. \n\nUSAA members hit with multiple phishing attacks. (2016, August 23).

Hackers would want to do this to stop or severely hurt the company’s network to prevent them from doing business for an extended period, causing them to lose money. They could also blackmail the company by consistently bringing down their network and demanding things like money. One example of this happened to a major DNS provider, Dyn in October of 2016. This caused many large websites, such as Spotify and Twitter to go down due to this attack. Bringing down a major DNS provider such as Dyn not only caused them to lose business, but also caused major companies such as Spotify and Twitter to go down and lose money as well. Other businesses that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks are internet service providers (ISPs) and companies that only exist online such as Amazon. If these companies were to be the victim of a DDoS attack, it would severely hurt their business as well as their reputation for being secure. To prevent a DDoS attack, a company could implement DDoS mitigation systems, as well as get a strong firewall on your servers. \n\nSource: \nTurton, W. (October 21, 2016).

By doing so, cybercriminals can either install malware into one’s computer or convince one to hand over personal information. Phishing can be performed through email, phone system or VOIP, or downloads. There are different forms of phishing, which includes spear phishing, whaling, and vishing. Spear phishing targets a specific group of people. Whaling targets senior or high level executives such as CEOs and presidents within an organization. Vishing is a form of phishing that uses a phone system or VOIP.\n\tIn many cases, phishing occurs more in one-on-one attacks, by using the names of popular online resources (ex. social network, online banking services, or online games) to lure in individual users (Ilyin 2015). But how does this affect businesses? Businesses are often affected by Business Email Compromise (BEC or CEO fraud). This occurs when a CEO’s email accounts are compromise and hackers will pose as a senior or high level executive to try and entice an employee to perform a bank transfer, send personal employee information, or revel customer details (Bridgwater 2016). This attack can affect range from small businesses to large corporations; however, it is more common with higher corporations. An example of this incidence would be Mattel in 2015. On April 30th, the finance executive received an email from the chief executive to transfer money to a new vendor in China. The finance executive was able to acquire two approvals from the high-ranking mangers and the payment was approved and transferred. Hours later, this payment was mentioned to the CEO, Christopher Sinclair, and he said he never made a request. By the time they tried to cancel the transfer, it was too late; the money was already in China. Mattel had to fight the fraud with Chinese authorities and luckily because they fought correctly, they were able to get back their three million dollars (The Associated Press 2015). \n\tThe only way to prevent a hacker from stealing information from one is to not have a social media presence or to go “off the grid” (Bridgwater 2016). However, this is not going to be possible with the world being connected to the internet. The best ways to protect oneself and one’s business includes being cautious with emails that include links and/or attachments because it can be a link/attachment sent by cybercriminals to install malware on your computer. Also, do not share sensitive information (ex. passwords, social security number, etc.) as one may not know who they are sending it to or who is intercepting the information. And finally, be cautious in order to prevent yourself from being a victim for phishing. \n\f\nAPA Works Cited \n\nBridgwater, A. (2016, July 12).

While e-mails, text messaging, and instant messaging have created new pathways of communication, all of these alternatives are also vehicles that criminals can use to steal or access valuable information. In order to do this, criminals use a type of social engineering call phishing, According to the Cambridge English dictionary, “phishing is an attempt to trick someone into giving information over the internet or by email that would allow someone else to take money from them, for example by taking money out of their bank account.”\n\n        One of the ways that phishing works is through emails. Phishers send out emails, sometimes millions of messages. The email contains a message that appears to come from a well-known and trusted company that is familiar or used by the recipient. Usually the message includes the company's logo and name, and it often includes an important or urgent message. The message also includes an attachment or a link that, once the victim clicks on it, will install malware on the user’s device, or direct the user to a malicious website that is set up to trick them into providing personal and financial information.   \n\n        Any ordinary user or business is in threat of falling for a phishing attack. These include online retail stores like eBay, banks, small business websites, and personal bank accounts. As an example of a phishing attack, BBC news reported on March 22, 2017 that a Lithuanian man had been charged with tricking two U.S. technology firms into wiring him $100 million through an email phishing scam. The U.S. officials said that the man was posing as an Asian-based manufacturer, and that he tricked the staff into transferring money into bank accounts under his control. He pretended to be a popular Asian computer hardware company, and in the emails, he asked the social network and web-service provider to send payments to his bank account in Latvia and Cyprus, instead of the real bank account in Asia. The companies were not named, but were described as U.S.-based multinationals, with one operating in social media. This is an example of how anyone can be a victim of a phishing attack, including the most sophisticated technological companies, as in this case. \n\n        Being cautions and suspicious of any email or instant message received that might ask the user to click or download an attachment is one of easiest ways to prevent phishing. There are many methods of prevention, like contacting the company that appears to have sent the email in order to confirm that is legitimate. This also allows the company to take action to warn other customers and users of potential phishing attempts appearing to come from that company. It is very important to be cautious because phishing is one of easiest way for criminals to obtain personal information and steal money.\n\n\n                                                                                Bibliography\n\nLord, Nate (2017, January 26).

One of the many different types of cyber-attacks is DDoS.\n\tDDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Services. A DDoS is when an attacker launches a DoS attack from multiple computers, which causes traffic to the site to slow down or even causing the site to crash. The software and technology industries is one of the most likely industries to get targeted by DDoS attacks. “The report reveals that the most popular attack vectors against the software and technology industry were DNS and NTP reflections and amplification attacks, accounting for 33% and 26% respectively” (Bender). Financial services such as banks are also prone to DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack on a bank would make it so that people trying to access their bank accounts would not be able to due to the build-up of traffic from the DDoS attack. \n\tA recent example of a DDoS attack would be when a collective of hackers named Anonymous attacked Donald Trump’s websites. They planned to take down the website for his hotel chain as well as the website for his presidential campaign. Anonymous also attacked the campaign websites of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump around Election Day. Attacks like this could influence who a person would vote for during the presidential election.  \n\tThere isn’t a definite cure for a DDoS attack but sites can filter illegitimate traffic to help prevent the attack from happening.  \n\nWorks Cited\nBender, Hannah.

    "Q3": "The topic of DDOS, better known as distributed denial of service, will be further discussed in detail. Distributed denial of service is an intentional shutdown of a computer network that is executed by flooding data that is sent simultaneously by multiple computers. There are two types of DDOS that can be performed: an attack that floods services or an attack that crashes services. DDOS causes networks to move significantly slow, denied access to websites, and inability to open files. Additionally exploits in the network may cause buffer overflows which take up all the memory in the CPU.\n\n The method of attack is often used on frequently used web servers such as ones owned by a bank or a credit card payment gateway. Last year, Wired writer Kim Zetter reported \"The US government accused Iran of conducting a prolonged series of DDoS against the web sites of Bank of America and other financial institutions, presumably as retaliation for economic sanctions levied against Iran for its nuclear program.\" The distribution of DDOS attacks make it difficult for the attack to be stopped since it comes from several IP addresses. Multiple machines are usually compromised to attack by hackers controlling them with botnets, which are networks of private computers that contain malicious software. THese attacks are also utilized for hacktivism. Zetter also reported that \"members of Anonymous launched attacks against the sites of PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard in 2011 after the payment service providers refused to process financial donations intended for WikiLeaks.\" Its clear to see the attack can be used for various purposes.\n\nDespite the numerous reasons and methods used to execute these attacks, DDOS is fairly easy to defend against. One of the best ways to mitigate the attack is to simply be prepared for it. Write a code script that will monitor the web traffic and determine if the number of users or data packets significantly spike. Another way to mitigate the attack is to block all of the rogue packets that are floating around the network, this can be done by identifying patterns in the attack then setting up extra security on your firewall. Although the exhaustion of data could potentially keep your network from performing optimally, you could still be able to contact your internet service provider and survive the attack.\n\n\nWork Cited\n\nZetter, K.

    "Q3": "Diego Suris-Rodriguez\nIS 300/Section 4\n4/3/17\nDistributed Denial of Service Attacks\nHave you ever had trouble accessing a website or information on the web? Well what could have been the problem, was a denial of service attack (Dos). This occurs when an attacker targets a network connection or computers on a common server.  Typically a denial of service attack floods a network with information, preventing authorized users the ability to access it. When the attacker overflows a network with information, it either slows or stops the server from accepting anyone from viewing that website. One specific technique used to achieve this goal is a distrusted denial of service attack (DDos). The difference between this threat and a denial of service attack is that a DDos attack uses multiple computers and network connections to flood a target. A number of these computers are what are known as botnets, which are infected computers that have been compromised by Trojan viruses. When an attacker launches their attack these botnets correspond to the instructions of the attacker and contribute to the flooding of the network.\n\tAll network connections are susceptible to a distributed denial of service attack. As long as a person, a company, or an organization is running a website on the internet there could be a potential attack. For example, in the past companies such as blizzard, an online gaming company, have been hit numerous times by DDos attacks. PoodleCorp has confessed to a few of these attacks. They targeted the attack at battle.net to stop players from being able to launch the game. Another example of a DDos attack is when hacktivist group, Anonymous attacked the Canadian government, claiming to be protesting new legislation that had just pasted. They were able to crash government websites and emails for a 2 hour period. \n\tWith any online network being at risk to a DDos attacks, how do you prevent it? Well in truth there is not a clear cut answer. However, there are ways to decrease the likelihood of an attack by installing and maintaining antivirus software, as well as using a firewall. The problem is that the targeted server cannot differentiate from a compromised network connection asking to join the webpage and real users attempting to join. Defense against botnets, follows in a similar manner. When determining if your smart devices is infected with a Trojan, and is a botnet. Owners should monitor the speed of their device and ensure that no ram is going unaccounted for. Factory resetting the device will restore its integrity.\n\nCitations\nMcDowell, Mindy.

Norton’s definition of a botnet is “one of the most sophisticated and popular types of cybercrime today. They allow hackers to take control of many computers at a time, and turn them into \"zombie\" computers, which operate as part of a powerful \"botnet\" to spread viruses, generate spam, and commit other types of online crime and fraud”. The most popular types of online crimes committed with the use of botnets are stealing ones credit card information, bank informations, sensitive informations, DoS attack, and click frauds. What all these online crimes have in common is when someone is attacked via botnet, user most likely are unaware their computer has become a botnet and every sensitive information within that machine could be compromised. According to Norton hackers tend to Dos attack everyday users because it’s much easier to pull off with less risk and it will satisfy their “thrill of the bothered”. But attacks via botnet is not only limited to the average users, it could also target big businesses but it would be more difficult to pull off successful attacks on larger targets. Norton has also given a list of ways to combat botnets: 1. Install top-rated security software (such as Norton 360). 2. Configure your software’s settings to update automatically. 3. Increase the security setting on your browser. 4. Limit your user rights when online. 5. Never click on attachments unless you can verify the source. 6. Ensure that your system is patched with the most current Microsoft Windows Update. 7. Set your computer’s security settings to update automatically, to ensure you always have the most current systems patches. These methods are not 100% fool proof but it will give your computer a better chance in defending against a botnet attack compared to someone who doesn't follow any of the prevention methods. \n\nCitation\nNorton (2017).

    "Q3": "One of the most common types of threats in todays connected world is vishing, also known as phone phishing. Vishing is the act of someone calling another party and gaining access to private information by deceiving and misleading the receiver of the phone call into providing them access to their personal information. Sometimes the party initiating the phone call is human other times the voice you hear is digitized using text to speech software. One of the most common text to voice scenarios features someone calling about recent fraud on your credit/debit card and asks for you to put in your vital information such as card number, expiration date and security code which gives them access to make purchases on your behalf. One of the most common instances of a human voice involves the person initiating the vishing to call and inform a party that their computer is infected with a virus and they are calling on behalf of your internet service provider to assist with removal and they walk you through giving them remote access to your computer or minimally access to your home network. By giving them remote access to your computer they have access to all of your files and can install backdoor programs such as key loggers to gain every keystroke you enter including user names and passwords. The worst part about vishing is everyone is a potential target as the attacker doesn’t need to know you personally and have your phone number they can use a “War Dialer” a piece of software which identifies legitimate phone numbers that are able to be called. The FTC reminds anyone who thinks they may be on the receiving end of a human operating the scam to resist pressure to make a quick decision. And to keep your vital information including all banking information and personal identifying information such as a social security number to yourself. And if you’re on the receiving end of a prerecorded call absolutely do not press a button to speak to an operator, instead you should hang up the phone immediately. And if you are unsure if the call was real, search for a contact number on a bill, banking statement, or the companies official website if they are familiar to you. If they are not familiar to you, avoid all contact until you can verify that the company is legitimate and not of malicious intent.\n\nBibliography\nMarguerite Reardon May 19, 2009 6:42 AM PDT @maggie_reardon.

    "Q3": "A distributed denial of service attack is one of few methods that hackers use to take down or make it near impossible for a consumer to access a service If it is connected to the internet. Hackers will flood the system’s bandwidth with an enormous amount of traffic which renders the internet service inaccessible. The best way to imagine a DDOS attack is a sudden flood in your basement. A DDOS attack would most likely target internet services which can range from Internet Service Providers to devices like Internet of Things. An example of this was the attack on the US Office of Personnel Management, where they received an attack due to weak security. Before the office could rein in the problem, the attackers were able to take millions of people’s name, address, and social security number. The best way to fight off a DDOS attack is to recognize the attack as soon as possible. If your internet service is under attack, immediately contact your internet service provider or your hosting company to help. The provider or host may have seen the attack coming already if not they too will be overwhelmed by the surge of traffic. The providers or host will follow up with dropping your packets of bandwidth in order to not spread the attack to other customers and divert your traffic through a cleaning utility to remove malicious traffic before the real packets arrive to the intended service. \n\nRiga, S.

    "Q3": "Phishing attacks are a form of social engineering that tricks users into clicking on a link or opening an attachment with malicious intent. Phishing can be performed over email, downloads or phone/VoIP; it is done to obtain Personal Identifiable Information (PII). There are three forms of phishing: spear phishing, whaling and vishing.\n\n\tSpear phishing is when a hacker gathers information about a target so that they can personalize the email. Instead of sending the phishing emails to a large group of people, the attacker targets a select group or an individual. By limiting the targets, it's easier to include personal information - like the target's first name or job title - and make the malicious emails seem more trustworthy. The same technique is used in whaling, however the targets are high-profile, like celebrities, politicians, executives, etc. Vishing is the same as phishing, however they do so over the telephone/VoIP. \n\n\tAny business can come under fire from phishing attacks, however the most likely to be the victims of whaling and spear phishing attacks are large corporations. The hacker will either send out a spear phishing attack to low-level employees or commence a whaling attack against its’ executives. For instance, back in 2014 Target fell victim to a spear phishing attack that allowed hackers to gain “access to Target’s computer system and stole financial and personal data of 110 million shoppers by tricking an employee at an outside vendor into clicking on a malicious email”. This is only one example of many incidences of employees being tricked into clicking on something they shouldn’t. The best way to combat these types of mistakes is training so that employees know what is safe to open/click on and what isn’t.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nSmith, G. (2014, February 12).

    "Q3": "Cyber Security is becoming a more and more important issue as more and more of our lives revolve around the digital world and the Internet. Consumers put in their personal information online and trust that the websites will keep it safe. Everything from bank account information to your mailing address is online, and this information is very tempting to hackers looking to make a quick buck. There are a variety of strategies that hackers use to gain access to your personal information, and phishing is one of the most common. \n\tPhishing is one of the sneakiest methods of gaining someone’s information because a good phishing scam will convince a person to put in their information voluntarily, so no real “hacking” and “stealing” is necessary. The hacker will send out an official looking email or phone call to a long list of people and tell them that for whatever reason, they must go onto a site and input all their information. That site will be linked to the hacker in some way and will allow him or her to access all of that information.\n\tThis method most commonly targets individuals directly since businesses usually have dedicated people to handle their online activities. Individuals are easier to scare and take advantage of, plus the hacker can hit many more individual people than businesses. \n\tPhishing is a very common and very effective hacking method, it preys on easily scared people and can cause a tremendous amount of damage depending on what information gets out. Always be suspicious of phone calls and emails what ask you for personal information. Legitimate businesses do not operate this way, and it is very important for people to be able to distinguish a scam from a legitimate inquiry\n\n\nPhishTank &gt; What is phishing?

    "Q3": "At the time of internet design, there was not enough focus on security, which left it vulnerable (Singh, Singh & Kumar, 2017, p. 344). Nowadays, cyber security has become an ever-increasingly demanding field, while the various types of cyber-attack are plentiful. These cyber-attacks are designed to bring computer networks to halt or shut down completely. They have the potential to even jeopardize national security. One of the most well-known cyber-attacks is DDoS. DDoS stands for ‘Distributed Denial of Services’ attack. The strategy of this attack is to overburden the computer network system or database server, affecting the bandwidth and access patterns. \n\tSingh, Singh, & Kumar indicate that these attacks are designed to prohibit access to authorized users. It is done by overloading the targeted system with unwanted IP packets. The evolved attack activates many separately located compromise systems(bots) at the same time to create an uncontrollable flow of network traffic. The two countries China and USA are the most targeted countries for DDoS attacks (as cited in Kaspersky Lab, 2015). Typically, the purpose of these attacks is to damage the business of competitors, steal money, and hacktivism. Specially to those organizations using internet for their business such as banks, the education industry, the entertainment industry and many more. These attacks are separated into three categories; volume base, protocol, and application layer attacks (as cited in Kostadinov).\nAmongst many detection techniques for these kinds of attacks, two significant approaches are admission control and normal access behavior. The admission control approach further divides into two categories; active queue management- which adjusts to the valid size of the queue, and challenge- which instructs the user to act. The normal access behavior approach also divides into two categories; score- which is a value assigned based on accessing patterns, and popularity- which is used to detect overloading attacks (Singh et al., 2017, p. 359).\n\n\nCitation\n\nSingh K., Singh P., & Kumar K.

    "Q3": "Rachel Skidmore\n4/3/2017\nIS 300, Section 4\nPhishing\n\tPhishing is a form of a social engineering attempt to trick users into clicking on a link or opening an attachment. The person committing this type of attack is using e-mail, phone system or VOIP or downloads in order to obtain personal information or install malware into the target’s computer (possibly even both). They pretend to be a legitimate organization or enterprise like a university, internet service provider or bank. “These messages usually direct you to a spoofed website or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft” (“What are phishing scams and how can I avoid them,” 2016).\n\tThose most vulnerable to these phishing attacks are entrepreneurs and small businesses. They lack a full featured network and data security processes and protocols that larger organizations usually have.\nThere are two different types of phishing attacks that can occur: spear phishing and whaling. Spear phishing “is a targeted communication towards employees or members of a certain organization or online group.” An example of this happening in real life is when, in January 2009, Bryan Rutberg was tricked into giving out his password to his Facebook account after clicking on a link in an e-mail he received that took him to a fake Facebook login screen. The attacker then used his account to scam his friends out of money. The other phishing attack known as whaling is “phishing that is targeted at corporate executives, affluent people, and other “big phish”.” An example of this attack in real life is when thousands of fake subpoenas were “sent” from the U.S. District in San Diego to corporate executives. When an executive clicked on a link inside of the e-mail to download the entire subpoena, a key-logging software was installed instead (Palmer).\nPhishing attacks can sometimes be hard to identify but there are definitely ways to avoid them and protect oneself from them:\n•\tYou can use trusted security software and set it to update automatically. You shouldn’t email personal or financial information. \n•\tYou should only provide personal or financial information through an organization's website if you typed in the web address yourself and you see signals that the site is secure, like a URL that begins with https (the \"s\" stands for secure). \n•\tYou should review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them to check for unauthorized charges. \n•\tOne last thing you can do to avoid phishing scams is to be cautious about opening attachments and downloading files from emails, regardless of who sent them (The Federal Trade Commission).\nPhishing attacks are just one of the many types of cyber-attacks that plague consumers today and by increasing awareness, perhaps the potentially devastating damage can be curtailed. \n\nCitations\nWhat are phishing scams and how can I avoid them?

Phone Phishing, or more specifically Interactive voice response, is when someone calls on the telephone and pretends to be someone else, in order to trick the subject into giving the scammers money. An example would be someone pretending to be the  IRS, threatening to arrest the victim if they do not pay some fee. Phone Phishing targets random people in hopes to play off fear of a negative repercussion for not cooperating. \n\nAs a security guard at Charlestown retirement community, this type of scam is most popular with the elderly residents. One resident reported that someone called pretending to be her grand-daughter and advised she needed the resident to go to the store and purchase $2,000 in I-Tunes gift cards to make her bail. This resident lost $2,000 to the phone phishing scam. \n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, Victims should avoid making any immediate decisions and ask as many questions as possible. The IRS advises that they would never call demanding money over the phone as well. These types of scammers try to pressure victims into make quick, irrational decisions without having time to think about it, or seek advice. The Federal Trade Commission’s website advises if it is a “robocall” just hang up the phone immediately. (Federal Trade Commission,  2014)\n\n\nFederal Trade Commission. (2014). Phone Scams.

    "Q3": "Phishing\n\tIn today’s world, there are many different types of cyberattacks.  These types of attacks occur when a hacker is trying to gain personal information of others.  One of the most common type of cyberattack is phishing.  Phishing is the attempt to acquire personal information, usually by hackers, through electronic means of communication.  Businesses that are the most affected by phishing are those that are strictly online.  Some examples are Snapchat, PayPal and Care.com.  The most common types of phishing attacks that these companies fall to are Deceptive Phishing and Spear Phishing.  Deceptive phishing is when hackers impersonate an authentic company to obtain users’ personal login information.  For example, PayPal users receive emails confirming recent purchases, as well as, reminding users to check their accounts.  Hackers will send out emails to users impersonating PayPal.  The email will tell the user to check their purchases on their account by providing a fake link.  This link will take them to a website that looks exactly like the PayPal login.  However, the URL at the top of the website will read “Pay.Pal” instead of “PayPal”.  Adding a period is a very small change to the URL that most users will not recognize.  This can be prevented by users checking the URL very closely, as well as, looking for grammar mistakes and spelling errors in the emails they receive.  Spear phishing is very similar to deceptive phishing.  However, in spear phishing, the emails that are sent by the hackers are personalized.  This means the hacker includes the user’s name, company, phone number and other personal information.  Spear phishing is usually found more on social media websites.  This can be prevented by companies discouraging their employees from publishing personal information online and setup security training for their employees.  \n\nBisson, D.

    "Q3": "The type of cyber-attack that I will be discussing is the Logic Bomb. A logic bomb is a set of malicious code that is used to delete file or cause severe damage. These types of attacks are hard to detect, as they are dormant until a specific condition is met, such as a specific time or date. When the condition is met, the code is executed, which can lead to all sorts of destruction if it is not stopped. These type of attacks usually occur within businesses or companies and are set by employees with poor intentions, mostly because the employee was going to be fired. A really good example of this incident occurring happened back in 2011. “Douglas Duchak, 46, had worked as a data analyst at the TSA’s Colorado Springs Operation Center… He planted the malware in late 2009, after the agency gave him two weeks’ notice that he was being terminated from the job that he’d held for five years.” (wired.com) This fits the typical logic bomb occurrence perfectly, an angry employee who is about to lose is job, places malware within the company system that would have had the ability to “damage and disrupt data on the servers at some future date.” (wried.com) Duchak ended up getting caught before the malware could be released and he was sentenced to 2 years in prison. Luckily other TSA workers were able to find the malware before it could be released. This cant always be the case, as logic bombs can be put on more than just company computers. The best way to prevent yourself from having a logic bomb planted on your own system is to be careful on making sure you do not open any suspicious email attachments or download any pirated files.\n\nSource: \n\nZetter, K.

    "Q3": "The first type of attack that was discussed during the presentation were password attacks, the reason I decided to discuss this specific type of cyber-attack is mainly because passwords and personal verification are something that are so commonly used by most people who have internet access. When signing up for any sort of access to most websites and organizations online, there is a varication process that needs to happen before you can move forward. You must enter your first/last name, email address, and date of birth etc. But most important of all the verification information you enter is a unique identification phrase you must use to prove that it is you who is logging in for access, this includes letter numbers and symbols. Once you have completed your account, in most cases you may only need to enter you email address as your username or a unique one that you created and the password that was made prior. The username and the password are both important to your online protection, and in most cases, there can be issues in this department due to the general lack of a complex password being created as well as a less than unique password and username in combination, or simply failing to create a new password periodically to help prevent any issues down the line. A password is a very important form of verification and allow yourself to be vulnerable to attacks can be very dangerous, not only for individual people but also can be catastrophic for small and large business. \n\nNow in terms of business passwords can be used for multiple levels of access, and only certain people have access to specific things, starting at the bottom employees may only have access to their own account and moving all the way up to the manager, or CEO who will have access to everything including all employee info, accounts and important files. For those who are looking to gain access to this information through illegal means there are several different ways with which to access with which I will discuss further. \n\nThe first being brute force attack which simply involves using a constant flow of different combinations and phrases until stumbling upon the correct password, so using what you know about the person and hoping that they simply use a password in line with some facts about themselves, essentially attempting to guess yourself to the answer. In most cases a brute force attack is more useful for individual people than a business that requires an incredibly complex lengthy password, unfortunately there are some people who use simple passwords for their emails or logins for websites that are very basic because it can be very difficult to remember a password. Brute force attacks are best prevented by using a unique password, that is lengthy and involves letter, numbers and characters that cannot be easily traced to you which is standard for password protection. A dictionary attack which like the brute force attack uses a mass search for an ability to obtain the result however in this case it looks up common phrases and words within a dictionary, but it can be combatted like brute force by not using major or common phrases pieced together. Shoulder surfing is one of the simplest ways in which people can gain access to people’s information and it is simply looking over your shoulder while you are entering your information. Sometimes we can become so comfortable we fail to be aware of our surroundings, therefore I mainly think attacks like this can happen, and in this case individuals and business can be vulnerable to these types of things equally based simply on the person entering the password being unaware of those around them when entering very important information. \nKeystroke logging is another type of password attack that is very difficult to combat because it does not simply search for a large portion of what could be the password, it simple checks every single keystroke that you make on your computer and can even isolate the specific password strokes that you make, the software can be downloaded on your computer in the background and remains there unknown to you tracking your every keystroke. Simple virus protection for your personal computer and if you are a business having constant IT consultants tracking any background software that may be working on an employee’s computer. This is an ever-growing issue even today ARS Technica reports that some hackers have been able to place small devices as small as usb phone chargers that if within the vicinity of the computer wanting to be accessed they have full access to all keystrokes made on the computer wirelessly, which has now cause the FBI to issue a release warning companies to further protect their company information. Finally, there is form of video recording password attack which mainly involves recording the images within the screen of your computer, like a second screen, this can be an issue for everyone however most websites now have your password and login info to prevent this, but for those who don’t this is still an issue. \n\nPasswords overall are very important to keeping your information secure, but there are many ways in which for a hacker to obtain your information, so being completely competent and educated of the ways I which your information can be obtained is very necessary. Basic prevention is a complex password you periodically change though and the rest if you are just a person online is hope for the best while still using virus protection, and if you are a company having IT consultants check for backdoor applications running in the background. \n\nGoodin, D.

Online retailers, such as Amazon, are the types of businesses that are most likely to be victims of DDoS attacks. An example of a DDoS attack include the attack of Dyn, an internet infrastructure company that offers Domain Name System (DMS) services. The DDoS attack on the company caused many websites to inaccessible to their users. This attack overwhelms the company's server and incapacitates the server from completing requests to deliver content to users. DDoS attacks can be prevented by taking various measures, such as being familiar with the online traffic, adding filters to prevent excess traffic, and requesting the internet service provider (ISP) to reroute the incoming traffic to DDoS scrubbers to eliminate any traffic that may cause a DDoS attack.\n\nCitations:\n\nNewman, L.

It is one of the fastest techniques to steal someone’s or a group’s sensitive information. Based on my research and my personal experience, I have found that phishing is the most common type of attack users tend to face in regular bases.\n\tPhishing is defined as an attempt of information theft on individuals or groups and companies. This information is stolen for malicious reasons. From simply obtaining a name and address of a random individual, it can lead to an identity theft. A username and password of a company worker or technician is equivalent to access to all the business data, and even credit card details. Phishing can be executed for various reasons and can lead to huge consequences. A simple internet user, just by checking his emails, can be mislead and trapped in, a scam because phishing is usually carried out by emails and instant messaging like Whatsapp. The traps are usually in links or invites to an “interesting” deal, image, or article, through a website link. Hackers create a fake website that looks exactly like the legitimate one. For example, a Facebook page, an Amazon deal, or a survey accessible only after user identification. Once the user enters his information, (especially username and password), the link redirects him to the legitimate website, or often leads to a second level of fake webpages with more attempts to get other information from the user, like credit card number and phone number. This vicious loop of attempts is endless until the fake webpage ends up having all the information needed for its malicious goals (money stealing, identity theft, phone phishing), or until the user stopping the process. \n\tWhile phishing seems to be very hard to dodge, because it only relies on user’s lack of attention, there are some websites that provide examples of real emails and messages. By using FraudWatch International and Millersmiles, real and fake links, pages, messages, etc can be compared so they know what to look for. Improving security by creating multiple different passwords, eliminating spam emails, using signatures for important online transactions, using malwares incorporated to internet browsers like Avast, can all help significantly reduce the risks of phishing attacks.\n\nCitations\n\nFelix, Jerry & Hauck, and Chris, from the International HP Users Group.

A type of social engineering phone phishing is the use of telephone systems to access sensitive information from users. Hackers can gain access to users usernames, passwords, and credit card details immediately. Phone phishing uses fake caller-ID data to appear as if coming from a trusted organizations. Phone phishing attacks users on their phones. An example of phone phishing attack, messages appear to be sent from a trusted bank insisting users dial the number if any problems occur. The number, owned by the phisher, prompts the user to dial their pin and account numbers. This allows phishers to gain all bank account information from the users. Cybercriminals may also call to help solve computer issues or sell software. Well-known companies, such as Microsoft, do not make unsolicited phone calls to sell and specific computer software. Avoid giving your username, password, or allow access to your computer. .A phone phishing can be identified by the following statements; you’ve been selected for a special offer, you’ve won one valuable prize, you’ve won big money in a foreign lottery, and you’ll get a free bonus if you buy our product. To avoid being caught in phone phishing, don’t buy from an unfamiliar company, obtain and confirm telephone numbers, street address, business identity, don’t pay for free prizes, and never send money or give out personal information. \nWork Cited: \n“How to recognize phishing email messages, links, or phone calls.” Microsoft.Microsoft.Web.03 Apr. 2017.",

    "Q3": "There are many different types of attacks that people use. One such attack is known as a botnet. A botnet is a collection of internet connected computers that are infected with malware. This can allow the computer to be controlled remotely. The botnet operator is able to steal information and can also infect other computers and networks (Internet Society). Botnets are most often associated with spam. However they can be very malicious from time to time. The main problem with bot nets is that they are designed to run in the background. This way, the user may never even know that they had a botnet on their computer. A couple quick ways to prevent getting botnets is by having a firewall on your devices. This will make it harder for your device to get infected (Internet Society). Another technique is to disable auto run. Since botnets run in the background, many users stay unaware of whats being downloaded onto their computers. By having auto run off, the user will not have to worry about botnets installing malware in the background. Many technology companies need to take the idea of cyber attacks seriously. For example, in 2016 the Mirai botnet created one of the largest DdoS attacks. Over 150,000 devices were compromised  (Internet Society).  Whether they sell smart TVs or bluetooth speakers, they should be aware of the threat that botnets create. Companies also need to promote awareness of the harm botnets can create. This way, they will be able to create safer networks and safer devices that will reduce the amount of botnet attacks. \n\nInternet Society. (Oct 30th, 2015).

    "Q3": "William Kallal \n4/2/2017\nIS300, Section #4\nCyber Issue Writing Assignment #1\n\tVishing, also known as Phone Phishing with Interactive Voice Response, is a type of cybercrime that uses social engineering as a means of gathering information about an individual. Unlike traditional phishing, which relies predominately on authentic-looking, malware-ridden emails to scam potential targets, vishing relies on telephones that are manned by criminals pretending to be authority figures (Keyworth, 2016). These criminals might claim to be bankers, government workers, police officers, or even technical support representatives. \nTo reinforce their charade, the criminals perform a basic lookup of your publicly available information. When the criminals finally call you to gather your sensitive information via a spoofed telephone number, they do not come off as imposing or threatening. Instead, criminals scam their victims in the most charitable way possible. The criminals claim that the victim is in some sort of urgent danger and that they (the criminals) are there to solve your problems before it’s too late. They quell your concerns about their authenticity by proclaiming the information that they previously obtained. This information might include your street address, your social security number, the names of your family members, or even the location of your employer (Keyworth, 2016). Because human beings are gullible creatures, many people fall for the scam and relay their sensitive information without a second thought. Once the criminals ‘fix’ your problem and hang up the phone, they will either use your information to directly cause harm to you in some way (steal your identity, drain your bank accounts) or will sell it to the highest bidder on the black market.   \nVishing attacks often target the employees of small businesses and big corporate businesses (Brecht, n.d.). Since employees are hired to fill jobs at every level in a business, vishing attacks can happen anywhere. No one is immune to a vishing attack, not even business executives. In fact, in 2015, a prominent British businesswoman was scammed of £100,000 by fraudsters because she thought that the callers were legitimate employees of her bank (Keyworth, 2016).\nTo prevent Vishing, one should use extreme caution when answering phone calls (Brecht, n.d.). It is crucial to perform extreme vetting on the operator to verify that the individual is who they claim to be before you proceeding with the phone call. If there is any uncertainty, hang up the phone. Being rude to a caller is better than losing your entire life savings to some fake Nigerian prince or Microsoft tech support representative. \n \nBibliography: \n\nBrecht, D. (n.d.).

This attack occurred because the Home Depot did not encrypt their customer’s data on the computer registers in the store. This is considered a POS infiltration because this information was stolen from the point of sale origin of the registers. The information that was stolen ranges from credit card numbers (40 million people) and emails (53 million people) of customers (Stempel). The people who were affected had used the self-checkout lanes at Home Depot between April to September 2014 (Stempel). The article “Home Depot settles consumer lawsuit over big 2014 data breach” states that “the intruder used a vendor's user name and password to infiltrate its computer network, and used custom-built malware to access shoppers' payment card information” (Stempel). Home Depot resolved to improve their data security and hire a chief information security officer to prevent a future attack. Home depot has learned that there needs to be layers of high level of security to prevent another similar data attack. It is estimated that Home Depot has paid around $161 million to date because of the attack (Stempel). \n\nCitation\nStempel, J. (2016, March 8).

According to Richard Henderson, a threat researcher in Vancouver, the bomb dictated exactly when the malware was supposed to begin its mischief. The attack was carried out simultaneously on three banks and two financial institutions wiping out the hard drives and master boots. \nThe malware had four main parts and each had a unique part to play in the operation. The first part is the Agentbase.exe that initiated the wiping of data, then the hex string which was the timer and a module used to delete data from the linux machines. There is a high possibility that this trojan was installed using a phishing email which was sent out a day prior to the attack. \nThere is some speculation that the attack was orchestrated by the Whols hacking group but there is no concrete evidence to back this assertion.

    "Q3": "Many companies are targeted by hackers and other criminals due to the large amount of customer data that these companies hold. Being attacked can cause much of a headache not only for companies, but individuals themselves. Being aware of how information systems and technological attacks work could help prevent hackers from getting into systems. The attack that I am going to elaborate on is the 2014 Home Depot security breach attack. \nOn September 8, 2014 Home Depot released a statement confirming that their payment data systems had been breached. A targeted phishing email was sent to Home Depot employees who were tricked into giving out system credentials.  Hackers used a vendor’s stolen log-on credentials to penetrate Home Depot’s computer network and install custom-built malware that stole customer payment-card data and e-mail addresses (Winter, 2014). Once the hackers entered the system, and the malware was installed; it gathered information from the computer and sent it back electronically to the hacker. The malware, which has since been removed, was installed on self-checkout registers and were predicted to have been there since April of that year (about 5 months). Once the hackers breached the system, they did their secret work, operating during normal business hours, stealing data, collecting data, transmitting data, and deleting their steps so they did not get detected. \nSince Home Depot was unaware that the breach was even happening, it allowed hackers to harvest information from 56 million credit and debit cards and 53 million e-mail addresses in the United States and Canada. Home Depot reported that the e-mail addresses did not contain passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive personal information; however, did reiterate common tips to guard against identity theft and warned customers to be alert for phishing scams. Home Depot also stated that debit card PIN numbers were not retrieved by hackers and offered free identity theft protection services, including credit monitoring, to customers who may have been affected. Breach-related expenses including, investigation expenses, providing identity-protection services and credit-monitoring for customers, extra customer service, legal costs, and claims form the card networks, cost Home Depot an estimated $250 million (Winter, 2014). \nThe obvious target in this data breach was Home Depot, however, Home Depot’s customers were even more of a target because it is their credit and debit cards and e-mail addresses that the attackers were after, they just had to go through Home Depot to get that information. There were several countermeasures Home Depot could have had in place to prevent the breach from happening and to have been able to detect the breach sooner, minimizing the impact. Home Depot didn’t have secure configuration of the software or hardware on the Point of Sale terminals and no regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning of the POS environment. They also didn’t have proper monitoring capabilities and management of third-party vendor identities and access was lacking. Home Depot only found out that they were being attacked because suspicious credit account numbers were up for sale on an online forum for hackers (Hawkins, 2015). Once, they found out, they acted immediately by taking necessary measures to delete the malware and investigate. They installed Point to Point encryption to prevent data from being captured in memory and network segregation to separate the POS network from the rest of the corporate network (Hawkins, 2015). \nI think that Home Depot definitely learned a lot from this security breach and have realized the seriousness of having a legitimate security system.  They didn’t think that they needed to take the necessary security measures or be a victim in an attack like this even though another big retail store (Target) had just been through the same thing. Home Depot responded to the event appropriately and has since been more proactive instead of lazy when it comes to security measures. With technology today, anyone can be a victim when it comes to hacking or other attacks if they are oblivious and do not take essential actions to prevent or counter them.\n\nWinter, M.

How is it possible a country’s power outage was caused by hackers? It sounds so unreal, but it happened.  A power grid attack is a cyber attack that occurs when a hacker disrupts the electrical supply system by performing spear phishing tactics towards specific groups or companies. Ukraine’s power grid attack was very skilled-oriented and successful. The cyber attack took a lot of planning in a duration of months, but the synchronized attack performed exactly how the hackers planned it would be done.\n\nOn December 23, 2015 at 3:30pm, residents of Ivan Frankivsk in the western part of Ukraine were preparing to end their workday shifts meanwhile, inside the Prykarpattyaoblenergo control center (power distributor to the residents), one worker was organizing papers at his desk when the cursor on his computer suddenly skittered across the screen of its own consent. As quoted, “He watched as it navigated purposefully toward buttons controlling the circuit breakers at a substation in the region and then clicked on a box to open the breakers and take the substation offline. A dialogue window popped up on screen asking to confirm the action, and the operator stared dumbfounded as the cursor glided to the box and clicked to affirm. The operator grabbed his mouse and tried desperately to seize control of the cursor, but it was unresponsive. Then as the cursor moved in the direction of another breaker, the machine suddenly logged him out of the control panel. Although he tried frantically to log back in, the attackers had changed his password preventing him from gaining re-entry. All he could do was stare helplessly at his screen while the ghosts in the machine clicked open one breaker after another, eventually taking about 30 substations offline.” (Wired) Once the hackers were in the system, they also struck two other power distribution centers in which left more than 230,000 residents in the dark. The hackers also disabled backup power supplies to two of the three distribution centers. \n\nThe targeted audience were Ukraine’s power distribution centers and in some way the residents because they were also affected by this maliciousness. There is no exact total amount of damage that resolved Ukraine to restore the power, but according to Andrew Follet, reporter of Daily Caller, stated, “A single minute of grid downtime can cost up to $15,447. ” Just imagine how much that would total to be when Ukraine’s power was out for one to six hours, that amount is estimated to be close to 3 million USD. As mentioned in the description of what cyber attack was identified—known as a spear phishing attack. Hackers created a phishing campaign that delivered emails to workers at three of the companies with a malicious Word document attached. When workers clicked on the attachment, a popup displayed asking them to enable macros for the document. If they complied, a program called BlackEnergy3—infected their machines and opened a backdoor to the hackers.\n\n\tThe resolution for Ukraine was setting a stronger security system on each of the three power distribution centers and the breakers monitoring any discrepancy within the power supply system. The lesson learned were for employees and the workers in making sure they do not open any malicious emails that may cause the attack to happen again. \n\n\nCitation:\n\nZetter, K.

A Mirai attack is malware that infiltrates Internet of Things devices, which is any device that is connected to the internet, thus creating an immense attack. The malware creates botnets and is able to take control over the devices and participate in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This was a massive attack since it hacked into various IoT devices. It was also a warning to all companies and users to take extra precautions when it comes to protecting personal information.  \nInitially, Dyn had automated defenses during the attack. However, as the attack worsened, they had to take more complex measures.  According to Scott Hilton, executive vice president of products at Dyn, methods such as “traffic-shaping incoming traffic, rebalancing of that traffic by manipulation of policies, application of internal filtering and deployment of scrubbing services,\" (Loshin 2016) were implemented to survive the attack.\nThis attack was a wake up call for companies and consumers to take many precautions. Companies started updating their systems with the latest malware security software, changing passwords to multiple passwords rather than keeping one default password. Consumers also need to have secured devices by updating their security software . Many consumers fail to do this because they doubt the risk of a potential attack.

The Stuxnet worm is also a rootkit exploit that targets Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. SCADA systems are used in power, water and sewage plants, as well as in telecommunications and oil and gas refining. For example, it is used in power plants, water treatment facilities, and gas lines. Stuxent was designed to alter Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The job of PLCs is to automate industrial type tasks such as regulating flow rate to maintain pressure and temperature control. \nStuxnet code included stolen digital certificates so the malware appeared legitimate and could avoid detection by traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). After Stuxnet surfaced, researchers quickly began to reverse engineer the malware. It is generally believed that Stuxnet was designed to cripple a facility's infrastructure. “For security reasons, many of the hardware devices used in industrial control systems (ICS) are not Internet-connected (and often not network connected). To counter this, the Stuxnet worm incorporates several sophisticated means of propagation with the goal of eventually reaching and infecting STEP 7 project files used to program the PLC devices.”\nThe worm is more likely to target computers running the Windows operating systems. “However, the PLC itself is not a Windows-based system but rather a proprietary machine-language device.” Hence Stuxnet simply traverses Windows computers in order to get to the systems that manage the PLCs, upon which it renders its payload. To reprogram the PLC, the Stuxnet worm seeks out and infects STEP 7 project files. STEP 7 project files are used by Siemens SIMATIC WinCC, A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and human-machine interface (HMI) system used to program the PLCs.\n“Stuxnet contains various routines to identify the specific PLC model. This model check is necessary as machine level instructions will vary on different PLC devices. Once the target device has been identified and infected, Stuxnet gains the control to intercept all data flowing into or out of the PLC, including the ability to tamper with that data.”",

    "Q3": "Andrew Luu\n\tThe OPM breach of 2015 is a prime example of how nobody is safe from breaches of information and getting hacked. The breach was believed to have started in 2013, but was not detected until 2015, two years after it initially started. This failure to detect the breach for so long caused 22.1 million people, including government employees and contractors, as well as their friends and family to lose their sensitive information (Nakashima, 2015). Approximately 21.5 million people lost their information that was in an OPM repository of security files (Nakashima, 2015). An additional 4.2 million people were affected by another database containing personnel records, including Social Security numbers, job assignments and performance evaluations (Nakashima, 2015). The hackers had such extensive access, that some U.S. officials think that every file associated with OPM since 2000 was exposed. This attack on the U.S. government raises the question that if the government was breached for two years, then how can we, as ordinary citizens, combat hackers.\n\tThe OPM breach began with a phishing email and another actor spoofing the OPM website, with HTTPS clearance to collect data. The website was up for five months and once an employee logged into the spoofed website or opened the link in the phishing email, they would upload malware to collect the employee’s information. The target of this attack was any federal employee in order to gather their information, preferably those employees with a high security clearance so that the hackers could access classified files (Nakashima, 2015). In addition to employee security information and Social Security numbers being taken, fingerprints and detailed financial and dental records were taken as well (Nakashima, 2015). The hackers in this breach seemed to be interested in taking not only government related information, but they wanted all the information pertaining to employees as well. \n\tThere are many things that OPM and the government could have done to prevent this breach of data. They could have been much more proactive in searching for any potential breaches of data. One of the only reasons why the breach was detected was because OPM implemented new cybersecurity tools that OPM had installed (Naylor, 2016). If OPM had not implemented these tools, the breach could have stayed open for much longer, and even more information could have been taken. They could do monthly checks for any breaches of data. When the OPM website was spoofed, it was up for five months before it was taken down, which is much longer than it should have could collect employee information. In the end, OPM’s director at the time Katherine Archuleta, resigned. New OPM director Beth Cobert, has now implemented two-factor authentication for employees when they login to their computers (Naylor, 2016). Employees can no longer access their personal emails from government computers (Naylor, 2016). OPM has also developed new software to better detect malware (Naylor, 2016). The government now actively monitors any computers that are connected to their network as well as what data is going in and out of their system (Naylor, 2016). From this attack, we now know that nobody is safe from hackers, not even the government. We also learned that being proactive is one of the best ways to combat hackers. We also learned to never open phishing emails and to always be cautious of the websites that we visit and use to make sure that they are the real ones.\nSources:\nNaylor, B. (June 6, 2016).

Similar to the Home Depot data breach and the Target 2013 cyber breach, the OPM Breach was also a victim of phishing. OPM’s use of older systems and lack of multilayer defenses were two vulnerabilities that hackers used to exploit. \n\n\n\tThe main targets of the attack were individuals who had once applied for a security clearance. Even people that were related to those that had undergone federal background checks were not spared. For five months, the hackers had access to employee credentials, such as name, birth date, home address and SSN. The attack began as a phishing email attack. With the stolen certificate obtained, the hackers were able to upload malware. The United States, in trying to create a more efficient IDA to recover for the 2013 attack, had its OPM website spoofed with the use of a HTTPS certificate.\n\n\n\tBecause the government were not as worried as they should have been, given their extremely slow-moving processes, they have increasingly became vulnerable targets. To deal with the security breach, OPM employees were required to use two-factor authentication, a password and secure card, to login to the computers. Access to Gmail from the office computers was blocked and malware detection tools were implemented. The government is also actively monitoring the data moving to and from the system.\n\n\nNaylor, B.

    "Q3": "IS 300 Cyber Attack Essay\nTarget 2013 Cyber Breach\nTrevor Radford\n\tIn 2013, Target was hit by one of the nastiest cyber attacks that has ever occurred to a retail store. The breach was the second largest ever reported by a retailer involving “nearly all of Target’s 1,797 stores in the United States” (reuters.com), and it ended up causing 40 million payment cards to be compromised within a matter of days. \n\tThe attack was carried out in a very interesting fashion. The hackers phished a third party contractor called HVAC. The hackers were then able to use the credentials that HVAC had to get into Target’s access portal. They then proceeded to infect the Windows file server being used by Target. The hackers then found and infected Target’s POS system with malware. The malware that the attackers planted in the POS system allowed them to scrape RAM off for clear text CC stripe (meaning they were able to take the credit card info from the machine as customers made purchases). The stolen data was then sent to an internal server, which was then extracted to FTP servers for the hackers to do with as they wish. \n       The timing of the attack could not have been much more perfect for the hackers. According to reuters.com, “The hackers worked at unprecedented speed, carrying out their operation from the day before Thanksgiving to this past Sunday, 19 days that are the heart of the crucial Christmas holiday sales season.” (reuters.com) With their attack going on during Black Friday and the most hectic spending due to the holiday season, an estimated $162 million dollars was lost by Target, with hackers making an estimated $50 million in profits. The hackers were targeting the large amount of holiday shoppers that were flooding the stores to make all of their last minute purchases.\n      This attack led to Target seeing a loss in profits during a time where profits are supposed to be very high. The attack also hurt Target’s online business, which they had been trying to promote before the attack ensued. The one thing Target learned from this attack was to make sure that 3rd party contractors such as HVAC did not have unnecessary access to their main systems (would have prevented this whole attack from ever occurring).\n\nCitation\nFinkle, J. and Skariachan, D.

    "Q3": "In 2013, Target, was claimed to have been hacked, and lost millions of customers’ personal information, including credit and debit card numbers. This hack is a perfect example of how a little bit of patience could have gone a long way as Target had the means to stop this attack from happening, however a little laziness got in the way of that. \nThe hack happened when hackers compromised a third-party HVAC system. HVAC being Target’s heating and air conditioning systems at their stores. For some reason or another the third-party company that was providing Target stores with air conditioning had privileges to Target’s systems. Knowing this information, hackers targeted the HVAC system via phishing, and gained access to Target systems. From there they could get information about Targets Point of Sales (POS) system and compromise it as well. The goal of the hackers was to steal Target customers’ personal information and credit/debit cards. The malware installed from the phishing attack also had something with it called a RAM Scraper. After gaining access to Target’s POS system, the RAM scraper grabbed all the credit/debit card information from the memory of the POS system (Kassner, 2015). The estimated damages of this attack were roughly 40 million credit/debit cards stolen by the hackers, as well as personal information of those people. Target has offered people affected by the hack a free credit monitoring service and set up a telephone hotline for those affected. Target has also stated that they found the “root” of the problem and has solved it.\nThe lessons learned by everyone involved were that laziness should not get in the way of protecting customer’s personal information. At the end of the day, if your customer feels unsafe or insecure about shopping at your store, then you will lose business to other competitors by no fault other than laziness. Target has stated to have implemented improved monitoring and logging of system activities, POS management tools, Limited or disabled vendor access to their network, and Disabled, reset, or reduced privileges on over 445,000 Target personnel and contractor accounts (Kassner, 2015). These changes make it harder for hackers to get to Target through third party partners of Target through phishing since they have restricted access to Target’s systems. \n\nKassner, M. (n.d.).

Even though news and communication media reports attacks conducted by hackers, where very critical information is stolen from systems, sometimes people unfortunately tend to ignore these reports. The Target cyber breach of 2013 was probably the one attack that had a lot of people wondering if they were victims. This is mostly because Target is a big retailer where many people have done business with them at some point. In addition, this cyber attack happened in a very critical and busy time. It occurred during the Thanksgiving season when a lot of people did their holiday shopping, and it ranks as one of the worst attacks ever. Hackers stole information from people who shopped in Target stores from November 27, 2013 to December 15, 2013 (Washington post, 2014). This credit card data breach leaked information of as many as 110 million Target customers (Forbes, 2014).\n\n       Target reported that the initial intrusion into its systems was done through a third party vendor, which was a refrigeration, heating, and air conditioning subcontractor that worked at multiple Target locations. The hackers first broke into the retailer’s network on November 15, 2013 using network credentials that were stolen from the refrigeration and HVAC system. It appeared that the attack begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees of the HVAC firm. The attackers succeeded in uploading their card-stealing malicious software to a small number of cash registers within Target stores. This first attack was just a test to ensure that their point-of-sale malware was working as planned. Then around two days later, the intruders had pushed their malware to a majority of Target’s point-of-sale devices and were actively collecting credit card records from customers (Kerbs, 2014)\n\n       This attack affected customers in various ways, “Target announced that the customers who have had their card data stolen — have had their personal information compromised, as well” (Washington post, 2014). In addition to using the customer’s credit card for online purchases, information stolen such as names and mailing addresses could have been used by social engineers to trick people into providing even more sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers, or to obtain access into the customer’s computers. Besides affecting customers, this breach caused financial damages for Target. On February 25, 2015, “Target reported that the total breach expenses incurred from its massive data breach amounted to $162 million for 2013 and 2014 figures combined” (Pymnts, 2015).\n\n       Various lessons have come from this data breach, not just for businesses, but for customers as well. One of the lessons learned from this attack is that employees and personnel should establish basic security practices such as requiring strong passwords, and establishing appropriate Internet uses such as not clicking on suspicious or unsecure links. Businesses need to secure access to their business, especially access from third parties. It is very important to protect customer information, since they can be put at risk of identity theft, and businesses can lose customers, goodwill, and therefore, profits. As far as customer safety, it is always important to be cautious, regularly monitoring bank transactions using a secure connection, and not public Wi-Fi. Costumers must also be aware of social engineering practices and suspicious phishing emails that might contain malware that can steal or trick them into providing personal information. \n\n\n\n                                                                            Works Cited \n\nLynn, Jia & Jayakumar, Amrita (2014, January 10).

According to an article on Wired, a logic bomb caused a cyberattack that wiped the computer hard drives of broadcasting companies and banks in South Korea.  A logic bomb only activates when certain conditions are met.  Here, it was programmed to go off on a certain date and time.\n\tThe cyberattack was malware and it consisted of four files.  One of the files was what triggered the attack.  The file was programmed to trigger the attack on March 20, 2013 at 2pm local time.  When the attack happened, it overwrote the hard drive and master boot record on the computers and rebooted them.  When the computers were rebooted, there was a message saying that the bot device was not found and to install an operating system.\n\tThe damage done by the attack was that the hard drives of broadcasting companies and banks in South Korea were wiped.  It appears that the target audience was causing damage to infrastructure.  According to an article on the SHIELD Security Research Center, the culprit behind the attack was North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\tThe cyberattacks did not affect either the South Korean military or government, but they briefly interrupted some ATM services.  It was the broadcasting companies and banks in South Korea that were affected.  On March 19, the day before the attack, a phishing e-mail was sent to South Korean organizations that supposedly came from a bank.  It came with an attachment that was actually a downloader.  The downloader ended up downloading nine files from several different URLs.  This suggests that the malware may have been on the machines less than a day.\n\tIn conclusion, there was logic bomb attack in South Korea.  The resolution there was that it was an attack designed to cause damage to infrastructure.  In addition, the malware that caused the attack may have only been on the computers for less than a day.  What can be learned from this is that e-mails need to be scanned for anything suspicious immediately.  This is because the malware supposedly came from a phishing e-mail.  Anything sent to a computer should be scanned for anything suspicious.\n\n\nCitation\n\nMassive cyber-attacks launched against South Korea on March 20. (2013, April \n15).

These cyber-attacks often take down servers which cause a business to lose money, steal information, and much more. One of the biggest cyber-attacks in recent years is the Target attack of 2013. \nBetween November 27 and December 15, 2013, as many as 70 million Target customers had their personal information stolen (McGrath). The hackers “broke into the retailer’s network using login credentials stolen from a heating, ventilation and air conditioning company that does work for Target” (Vijayan). The attackers used the stolen credentials to access Target’s network and install a malware that would collect the customer’s personal information. Target lowered its fourth quarter 2013 earnings guidance from $1.50 - $1.60 down to $1.20 - $1.30. During the time of the attack, Target expected its sales to drop 2.5%. The attack ended up costing Target $162 million (Fadilpašic). Since the attack stole information from customers, the attack targeted Target’s customers in order to get their credit and debit card information and steal their money. After the attack, Target improved their security by added “improved monitoring and logging of system activity” and also improvements in their “firewall rules and policies” (Kassner). The lesson learned from this Target attack is to strengthen your firewall and monitoring your system to make sure there are no intrusions. \n\tThe Target attack resulted in over 70 million people having their personal information taken which resulted in a loss of around $160 million. If Target implemented their whitelist and strengthened their firewalls, this attack would have been preventable. Safety precautions are essential for companies in order to protect their customers’ sensitive information. \n \nWorks Cited\nFadilpašic, Sead (2015, February 26).

Target missed their own internal alerts about the intruder in their system and found out about the breach when they were contacted by the Department of Justice. \n\n\tAccording to sources close to the investigation, the attackers were first able to gain access to Target’s network through a third-party contractor, an HVAC company, when an employee’s username and password was phished (Vijayan 2014). The HVAC company was given portal rights by Target’s system administration. The attackers were able to use the stolen credentials to access the contractor’s portals. The attackers found the internal window file server and infected the server. Target had a firewall on; however, they turned off their alerts so they did not know they were attacked. Later, the attackers were able to find and infect the POS system with malware. First, tested the data-stealing malware on a small number of cash registers, but later they were able to upload the malware to a majority of Target’s POS system (Vijayan 2014). The malware was able to scrape the RAM for clear data from credit card strips and send the credit card data to internal server. Finally, the data is exfiltrated to FTP servers. \n\nInitially, forty million customer information were compromised during Black Friday weekend and the information compromised included customer names, credit/debit card number, card expiration date, and CVV (card verification value). However, later Target found out that another seventy million customers were affected because their names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses were also stolen (McGrath 2014). This costed Target over $100 million dollars in damages. It also caused their fourth quarter earnings to range from $1.50 to $1.60 down to $1.20 to $1.30 (McGrath 2014). \n\nTwo years after the data breach, Target had to set up a $10 million fund in order to reimburse those affected by the breach, paying individual victims up to $10,000 in damages if they could document their losses (Kieler 2017). This process leaves out the millions of customers who did not suffer financial losses; however, they will face future risks of identity theft. The retailer also made other deals to pay affected banks $39.4 million for their expenses and $67 million to those affected with Visa cards. \n\nTarget claimed that the breach was unavoidable because of its sophisticated nature; however, the breach was avoidable and preventable. Target chose to give third-party vendors access to their networks but they did not secure their access. Target should have segmented its network in order to prevent third-party vendors from access their payment systems (Vijayan 2014). Also, they should turn on alerts for their firewall; though it may be tedious to keep track of alerts, it will alert Target as soon as unauthorized personnel try to access their system. This will prevent future data breaches. \n\nSome prevention methods that Target could use include locking credentials to prevent others from stealing them. Also, Target should practice strong passwords and password expirations to prevent misuse of credentials. Furthermore, authenticating individual users of their credentials (ex. two factor authentication), will confirm the individual user and whether they are part of the organization. Finally, auditing credentials will prevent the misuse of credentials and keep track of when credentials are being used (“Target breach: risks of privileged credentials and how to manage them” 2015). \n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited: \n\n(2015, September 21).

A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malicious software that are controlled as a group without the owner's knowledge or consent. The Mirai botnet was a network of outdated versions of Linux computers infected with malware. The primary of target of attack on the Dyn servers were internet connected devices and platforms such as printers, IP cameras, residential gateways and baby monitors.\n\nAlthough the motivation behind the attack was not clear, it has been reported that the method of infiltrating the servers was an execution of multiple DDos attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks. Distributed denial of service is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of bandwidth traffic from multiple web servers. These methods of attacks were accomplished through requesting a high number of domain name service lookups by pinging to millions of IP addresses connected to the servers. \nIn response to several “internet of things” devices becoming infected, the Dyn Operations and Engineering team used various mitigation techniques to recover their networks. However, since the attacks were executed at three different times of the day, there was some residual impact done to the networks that were targeted. These mitigation techniques included “traffic-shaping incoming traffic, rebalancing of that traffic by manipulation of any-cast policies, application of internal filtering and deployment of scrubbing services.” After a couple of days of deploying the mitigation efforts, the attacks subsided. Ever since the attacks occurred, Dyn has been conducting substantial analysis on the complexity behind the attack execution and opening up the conversation with internet providers on how to prevent or mitigate these incidents. \n\n\n \nWork Cited\n\n\"Update Regarding DDoS Event Against Dyn Managed DNS on October 21, 2016.\" Incident Report for Dyn, Inc.

    "Q3": "The cyber-attacks case study presentations shown in IS 471 indicate that most cyber-attacks start with naive users selecting a vulnerable password or clicking on a suspicious email.  Such actions assist hackers in finding vulnerable computers or the internet of things (IoT) to compromise the functionality of those devices in order to control them remotely. Cyber-attacks are almost always executed with the goal of hurting and/or stealing either a user's personal information or finances. \n\tAn example of one such attack was carried out against a law firm called Mossack Fonesca & Co. (based in Panama City) which provides offshore services. The attack was executed as a huge SQL injection cyber-attack. The attacker is still unknown. The attack inevitably resulted in 11.5 million documents stolen and eventually brought forth to a German media outlet  named Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Those documents were then shared with the Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to release them globally in 2016 (Sanders, 2016). The goal of a hacker was to unveil documents of corrupted politicians and overseas holdings of wrongdoers. The hacker(s) might have accessed these files through the company’s email server (McCarthy, 2016).\n\t We know that SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to operate mainly relational databases. In SQL injection attacks, the attacker feeds undesirable code in the form of a database query. In turn, the database engine returns the expected data after the execution of the query (Satter & Hossain, 2016, p. 2).\n\tAccording to Burgess & Temperton (2016), the version of Drupal was outdated with plenty of vulnerabilities. Drupal is the web content management software that was used by the law firm.  The analysis further showed that the front-end computer systems and client logins of the law firm were also outdated. The server of the firm was enabling insecure protocol and the structure of the URL was even predictable for backend approach.\n\tWhile the hacker remains a mystery, there are lessons to be learned at many levels. As an individual or a firm, realizing the value of software security updates and applying them promptly is critical. Educating management staff  about the importance of not leaving the software unpatched, as well selecting a software with minimal vulnerabilities is equally paramount. \n\tSo why do we as a society  provide hackers with a purpose to hack? Do organizations and entities have something relevant to us to hide? Is there a natural curiosity within us to hold others accountable for their actions? There is a hope that technology will someday enable humanity in achieving a transparency at the intellectual level where there is no fear to hide pertinent information, and in the spirit of discretionary transparency, no reason to hack. In the case of the Mossack Fonesca & Co. example above, executive management clearly had something to hide which was of interest to specific social justice hacker. \n\t\n\n\nCitations\n\nBurgess M., & Temperton J.

    "Q3": "Some time in late August, to early September, 2014, Home Depot's payment card database was breached. Approximately 56 million cards were compromised, collected, and sold to criminals on the Internet. The hackers infiltrated the network by using a third party logon credentials. They exploited a vulnerability in the Windows Software that allowed them to access the Home Depot corporate database. They then installed memory scraping software on 7500 self checkout terminals that would steal anyone's card that was swiped at them. In addition to the 56 million card numbers, they also got 53 million email addresses that were sold for phishing operations. This strategy is remarkably similar to a hack on Target the previous year, and it finally woke companies up to their vulnerability. Home Depot did not take heed of the warning set by Target, and they paid the price. This was a relatively basic hack that could have been prevented with a few important countermeasures, such as a secure configuration of the software on the terminals, or even simply doing a better job of segregating the terminals from the corporate network. Home Depot ended up paying damages to those affected by the breach to the tune of $25 million to banks, $134 million to the credit card companies, and $20 million directly to the customers. This is a huge payout, and Home Depot has responded by adding additional security measures to ensure this does not ever happen again. They have not disclosed what exact measures they have taken, but it is vital that they have done enough. Unfortunately it was too late to prevent this breach, but hopefully it will be enough to stop future attacks\n\n\nHawkins, Brett. (2015) Case Study: The Home Depot Data Breach.

    "Q3": "Mirai Botnet Attack\n\n“Botnets remain the top source of DDoS attack traffic. Four botnets generated 10 DDoS attacks exceeding 300G bps between July 2014 and December 2016, with the Mirai IoT botnet holding the top two spots.”(Kerner 2017) Botnet attack, a type of cyber attack that hackers use their code to control the huge amount of computers that have already been hacked to block the target system by the huge amount of data packs.\n\nThe attack occurred on October 21, 2016, and the attacking time was from 11:52 A.M. to16:00 P.M. This attack was known as Miral attacked Dyn Dns servers by different IP addresses from different locations. The major way of Botnet attack is by using the DDoS attack, and this caused a huge damage towards US regions, especially in the northeast region. Mirai Botnet Attack was accomplished by a large number of DNS lookup requests which from more than millions of IP address. This is why it was so hard to combat since the resource of the attack was not certain and can be anti-tracking. At the same time, the result was also impressive that 139000 of 145000 domains continued to dyn.\n\nThere is no target audience in this case. However, this type of attack can be used for between business and government in order to block their data processing and system functioning. Botnet attack can also be used to against the individual, but there is no certain way to use it. Every device that connects to the internet can be affected. One important part we need to notice is that the system we are using can already be hacked and be used as a tool to attack other systems without our awareness.\n\n\tAlthough Botnet attack is not a regulate virus that we can simply combat with, it can still be solved in certain ways. The first way to combat it is using Intelligent filtering to determine the unusual and trash pack. Second, we have to find the vulnerabilities as soon as possible to block the upcoming attack. Also, we have to always be aware of the firewall by updating it to the most recent version.\n\n\tCybersecurity becomes more important in nowadays because information system and data processing are more important to everyone. This is also the resource that cyber attack becomes more variable and unpredictable. Since our devices become smarter and depend on the internet, the lesson we need to learn is cyber attack can come everywhere and can happen anytime.\n\n\nReferences\nKerner, S. M. (2017).

    "Q3": "In our day and age technology has become a very significant part of our lives. Almost everyone has access to some type of technological device, whether it is a phone, computer, laptop, ipod, ipad or even a digital watch. Therefore almost everyone has been a victim of a cyber security attack, some more serious than others. According to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS). Cyber security attacks are malicious acts that compromise the physical security and also electronic security of an individual or company. Cyber security attacks also disrupts or  make attempts to disrupt the cyber tasks and operations. \nUnfortunately in the december of 2013, Target fell victim to a cyber security attack made on their system.  A cyber breach within Target’s Air conditioning system which allowed the attacker to gather some of their customer’s information. Up to seventy million customer’s personal information was illegally accessed. While up to forty million customers had their information stolen by the attackers. The attacker gained access to customer’s credit card information as well as debit card accounts that had been recently used during the Black friday up until December 15th sale period. After the cyber security attack was investigated, it was concluded that the reason Target suffered from this attack was due to the fact they failed to make use of their firewall alert system. The system database administrator within Target’s system turned off the firewall alerts which prevented the company from knowing when an attacker breached their system. If the system database administrator or even employees within the Target system made use of the firewall installed within their system the attack could have been prevented. Many companies are known for making this mistake, and the reason this mistake is used because employees claim to get tired or annoyed by the alert sounds and notifications these systems make. \nThe audience that most cyber attackers attack are companies that have deficiencies within their database or weak cyber security prevention methods. In order for companies to avoid falling victim to cyber security attacks, it is important that they keep the alerts for their firewalls on at all times. It is also important that they check their alerts frequently in order to stay up to date on things happening within their system. Cybersecurity attacks happen all the time, however it is important they are prevented because they can cost companies and individuals a lot of money. \n\n(2014, January 10)Target Data Breach Spilled Info On As Many As 70 Million Customers.

    "Q3": "Home Depot is one of America’s largest home improvement supply retailers with over 2,226 store nationwide. Prior to 2014, Home Depot had been a victim of 2 cyber-attacks. These attacks trigged Home Depot to consult security firms to help increase cyber defenses against cyber-attacks. Consequently, security contractors urged Home Depot to use an unused feature in its security software that would activate a key; which would provide a layer of protection to sensitive information in its credit card processing information system (Elgin, Riley & Lawrence, 2014). \n\nOn September 8, 2014, Home Depot confirmed a massive data breach on its customer database. The attack put 56 million customer’s credit card information at risk. Home Depot estimated expenses to be $62 million in damages that year for legal fees and “call-center staffing” (Elgin et al., 2014). The company also said that insurance covered $27 million in damages. \n\nOne of the main reasons Home Depot was hit by this large-scale attack was because it did not have its key activating defense feature turned on. Home Depot’s security division said that the system may have been hacked as early as April. However, cybersecurity experts said that Home Depot failed to make the necessary changes it had to make to prevent this kind of attack (Elgin et al., 2014). In other words, Home Depot had the knowledge and software to potentially prevent this attack but failed to do so.  This defense feature was developed after multiple large-scale attacks on other major retailers. The feature would work by detecting malicious software that attacks system endpoints in registers (Elgin et al., 2014). \n\nFrom August 2013 to February 2014, security contractors told Home Depot to turn on the activation key software called Endpoint Protection (Elgin et al., 2014). One defense consultant on a report said that Home Depot’s computers were very vulnerable because they had turned off the security feature, called Symantec’s Network Threat Protection (NTP), a firewall that ran on Windows (Elgin et al., 2014). To provide maximum protection, the firewall had to be run on all of Home Depot’s computers.  Instead, Home Depot would look for suspicious behaviors using outdated methods of detection, such as network monitoring.\n\nIt was unclear if the defense system could have thwarted the attack, but one cyber security expert said that the chances were very high to detect the malicious malware (Elgin et al., 2014).  Prior to 2013, Home Depot didn’t encrypt customer credit card information on registers and computers. Because of this, Home Depot was hacked on two separate occasions. Two attacks occurred: one in July 2013 and another in December 2013. The attack in July used a data-stealing virus at a Home Depot in Texas that infected 8 store registers. Similarly in December, a Home Depot store in Maryland had its database compromised by “Inforstealer” malware. In both cases, it was unsure whether the damages could be assessed or if the customer cards were at risk.\n\nPrior to 2012, former top executives at Home Depot told managers in the information security department to implement a low-end security system. The reason was because a high-end system would severely interfere with other “critical” information systems and was expensive (Elgin et al., 2014). Leading to the attacks, Home Depot was using a 2007 version of Symantec’s Endpoint Protection 11 (Elgin et al., 2014). Home Depot attempted to upgrade to a 2011 version called Endpoint Protection 12, however, the company’s database had been completely compromised by then.\n\nThe article’s target audience is to consumers and business retail owners because the article didn’t use complicated terminology, and explains what happened in a general sense. The article explained the events leading to the breach, and how it could have been prevented. The lesson of this article is to not cut corners on security measures in information systems. In this case, the Home Depot could have avoided losing millions of dollars if only they had turned on an existing security feature and used an updated antivirus software.\n\nCitation \nElgin, B., Riley, R., Lawrence, D.

    "Q3": "Jessica Wilson \nIS 300 Section 4\nProfessor Everhart\nApril 25, 2017\nHome Depot Data Breach\n\nA data breach incident is an unauthorized access to “sensitive, protected, or confidential data” which results in the potential compromise of “confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected data” (Borle, Sen, p315, 2015). The data may include information such as personal health information, personal identifiable information, trade secrets, or personal financial data. (Borlse, Sen, 2015). \nHome Depot is one organization that has been a victim of a data breach. In September 2014, Home Depot confirmed its data breach which expanded to include 53 million user emails. The attackers only stole email addresses but no additional payment cards, passwords or personal information were stolen. The attacker hacked into Home Depot’s network through a third-party vendor’s username and password. Though the attacker accessed into the network, the credentials “did not provide direct access to the company’s point-of-sale devices” (Kerner, p1, 2014). In addition, the attackers acquired elevated rights so they can navigate Home Depot’s network and deploy custom built malware on its self-check-out systems in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe attack was a result of several defensive inadequacies. It was a multistage attack. First, the third-party access by the attacker. Second, the privilege escalation issue. Third, the undetected malware. Lastly, the data was taken out from the network without being detected. \nData breach incidents result in severe financial and legal implications for targeted organizations. The incident affects both the targeted organizations and the individuals. A study by Ponemon Institute revealed that the average cost per incident is estimated to be approximately $5.9 million for organizations in the United States. On the other hand, the most severe data breach incident on individuals is identity theft which results in approximately $16 billion stolen from 12.7 million victims. \nHowever, for the Home Depot attack, there are no known costs. Home Depot claimed that “the company is not able to estimate the costs, or a range of costs, related to the breach” (Kerner, p1, 2014). \nA data breach attack targets organizations and individuals. If organizations are the victim, the attackers can access confidential data such as customer records or business reports. On the other hand, attackers can access information such as SSN, passwords or financial records if individuals are targeted.\nThe best resolution to a data breach attack is stick laws (Borle, Sen, p.332, 2015). Borle and Sen concluded that the strictness of state-level data breach disclosure laws correlates with a reduced rise of data breach which benefits consumers. Organizations can also outsource security protections to managed security service providers (MSSPs) so they can benefit from the expertise and reduce cost of complying with laws. \nFrom the attack, Home Depot and other organizations can learn to implement a proper change management system and access policy management system because these systems can recognize a privilege escalation and other signs of a potential attack. \nKerner, S.

Hackers were able to bypass the network security of Home Depot and implanted a malware into their payment systems which allowed the attackers to record all credit card transactions that took place and save all the credit card information to be sold later on the black market. According to Bloomberg.com Home Depot had ample security measures in place to prevent hackings like this from ever happening, but those security measures were turned off by upper management because they were simply annoyed by the constant email pings from these security measures. There was an estimated $62 million in damages that had to be paid for but Home Depots insurance was able to cover $27 million of the total. On top of that there was all the 56 million credit card informations stolen by these hackers. I believe the targeted audience was the customers and upper management, the attacker most likely just wanted to show off what they are capable of. But once Home Depot found out about the breach they were able to quickly resolve the problem by figuring out how the hacker was able to breach their system and safely removing the malwares that were found on POS machines, so the attacker wouldn’t be able to save more credit card information since he is denied from home depot servers. Some lessons Home Depot must have learned is that take security seriously. In reality Home Depot would never have had such a big breach if they hadn’t turned off their security systems, and making sure no one is implanting any malicious bug/programming within their systems. \n\nCitation\nElgin, B., Riley, M., & Lawrence, D.

    "Q3": "Hackers come in many shapes and sizes, some set out only to infect a single user and cause annoyance, while others attempt to steal a users personal information such as financial related logins, passwords, and card numbers. But there are also hackers who seek to infect multiple users with a single attack. In 2013 the retail chain Target was on the receiving end of a hack where customers of the retail chain had their credit card information stolen. \n\n\tIn the 2013 holiday season Target was the focus of a cyber attack which as many as 100 million customers personal information have been tied to. The attackers infiltrated Targets servers by sending a phishing email to and executed by the company who handles HVAC services for the retailer. And once the phishing email was executed it gave hackers credentials, that were provided by Target to the HVAC company to login and access Targets servers. The nature of the attack was to obtain financial and personal information of customers who shopped at Target during the busy holiday shopping season, The attack was estimated to cost target over $420 million before the potential class action lawsuit fees. The $120 million covers the reimbursement to the banks of customers who had false transactions as a result, the reissuance of cards with new account numbers, legal fees and credit monitoring for customers who were believed to of been taken advantage of by the hack. Additionally Target is opting to spend upwards of another $100 million to upgrade their POS system to accept chip-and-PIN cards to better secure their customers private data. It is worthy to note Target will be covered partiality by a $100 million cyber insurance policy as well as $65 million in liability coverage through another policy.\n\n      The primary takeaway for Target would be to restrict access to third party companies including ones that manage their utilities. Or to create a secondary server for only third parties to utilize where no employee or customer data is stored. Target also has taken the steps to further secure transactions by implementing the security chip and PIN combination to transact in their stores. Beyond that the entire issue becomes user error. The target employee that thought a single system for both first and third party users should be combined is a lack of judgment. Working in retail myself I learned that Best Buy has two entirely different systems for first and third party users. Additionally Fazio does not remote control the HVAC system for target the only had access to submit proposals, project management and electronic billing, which all could have been done through a private portal or slowed down by a paper format, alleviating the need for such privileged access. And lastly the hack was traced back to an original phishing email that infiltrated both Fazio and Targets networks. Overall all users who have access to sensitive material need to be trained to use enhanced judgment such as ensuring that the email that you received is from a known sender.\n  \nBibliography\n\nWallace, G.

Due to the time-specific nature of these simultaneous attacks, it is believed it was undertaken using a logic bomb. A logic bomb is programming code that is designed to execute under specific circumstances. This could be that a certain amount of time past or the failure of the user to respond to a program command. In short, a logic bomb has the effect of a delayed-action computer virus or Trojan horse. A logic bomb may be designed to display or print a malicious message, delete or corrupt data, or have other undesirable effects.\n\nWhen the cyber attack in question was triggered it wiped the hard drives and the master boot record of at least three banks and two media companies; additionally some ATM's were put out of operation. Researchers on the attack later discovered that a phishing email was sent to the South Korean organizations on March 19, 2013. It was camouflaged to look like it was coming from a bank. Attached to the email was a trojan which then downloaded 9 files from various URLs.\n\nThese malware files contained one called AgentBase.exe which triggered the mass deletion. Within the file was a hex string containing the date and time of the attack. When the internal clock on the machine hit the specified time, the wiping and rebooting of the systems began. Currently, the suspected perpetrators of the cyber attack is WhoIs; which is an anonymous group of hackers.\n\nThis article does a great job of educating the general public of how damaging cyber attacks can be. Currently the organisations affected are working together and individually  with cyber security professionals to track down the perpetrators of the crime. Some of the main lessons that can be taken away from this cyber attack experience include being selective of the emails that you open. If the sender is unfamiliar, do not open the email. Another lesson is to invest in good firewalls and antivirus software that can block or quarantine any of the malware that does happen to gain access to the computer system.\n\nAll in all such a large scale cyber attack on credible organisations like banks, proves that cyber security is becoming more and more vital in today's society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\nCitations\n\nRouse, M.

    "Q3": "Ukraine Power Grid Attack\n\n\tOn December 23, 2015, three Ukrainian power stations suffered power outages due to a cyber attack. The power outages lasted several hours and caused approximately 225,000 people in various areas to lose power. At the same time as the power stations were being taken offline the call centers were hit by a DDoS attack preventing the center from receiving reports of outages and slowing down the response effort. Hackers also used a software called KillDisk to erase master boot records and some targeted logs. Even though the attack only disabled the stations for a few hours, the damage that was incurred prevented the stations from returning to their previous operating capacity (Electricity 2016). It is still unknown exactly how much damage was caused by the attack to Ukraine’s power grid.\n\tThe attack started with hackers spear phishing to gain access to the networks of the power stations. Emails were sent out to individuals in the administrative or IT departments of the station. These emails contained an Microsoft office documents embedded with BlackEnergy 3. When these documents were opened a popup would appear asking to enable macros. Upon enabling macros BlackEnergy 3 was installed on the computer. The malware then created a direct link to the hackers allowing them to gather information and enable access. This step occurred over 6 months prior to the attack. When initiating the attack, hackers used remote administration tools to take control of operator workstations. Hackers disabled the breakers and then used KillDisk to wipe the boot records from the workstations. Malicious firmware was also uploaded to serial-to-ethernet gateway devices in order to ensure that in the event that operator workstations were recovered that remote commands would be unable to bring the power stations back online (Electricity 2016).\n\tAlthough there is still information that we do not know about the cyber attacks there are lessons to be learned from what we do know. The hackers initially gained access to the system through spear phishing. Application whitelisting and email whitelisting can impede hackers from infiltrating a network. Most viruses are delivered over email attachments. Educating staff and having a secure and contained environment in which attachments can be opened can prevent an malicious code from infecting the targeted computer. Segmenting systems between multiple firewalls can also ensure that if one system gets infected that infection will have a more difficult time traveling to other related systems. Despite all of the sophistication behind the hackers attack, they still had to shutdown the power themselves through remote access. Using a two-factor authentication system and decreasing the amount of access users have over remote access can make the system more secure (Electricity 2016). \n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

    "Q3": "Target Data Breach\n\n\tThe process of an individual’s private or confidential information released to the public is known as a data breach. Data breaches usually involve an attacker gaining access to unauthorized data from a company’s network. One of the largest data breaches took place at Target before Christmas in 2013.  A target retailer stated that “information stolen between November 27 and December 15, 2013, included personal information of as many as 70 million people.”(Forbes, 2014) This attack continued without being detected for over 2 weeks. The breach gained access to customer names, mailing address, phone numbers, and email addresses. Along with credit card numbers, card expiration dates, and CCV. Access to private information of customers is harmful and can lead to future scams, identity theft, and is a crime one can be convicted for. \n\nThe data breach is believed to have started when the attacker phished for Targets third party contractor, HVAC. It’s noted that an HVAC employee had access to unauthorized information in their system. The HVAC employee was able to access and implement changes to data that was authorized for higher level employees. This made it easier for the attacker to steal credentials and access HVAC’s portal. Once the hacker is in HVAC’s portal, he finds and infects the internal Windows file server with POS system malware called POS Trojan. This malware finds clear-text copies of credit card magnetic stripe information and then scrapes the RAM clear of data. At this time, no anti-virus solutions in the market could detect the malware. The malware then sends the retrieved information to the retailer windows file server and then forwards it to the attackers FTP servers. Now, all customer information is stored in the hacker’s servers. \n Over 50 million customer information was stolen and Target lost 162 million dollars in this data breach. To prevent this attack from occurring again, Target has taken steps to improve their “information security structure and the acceleration of our transition to chip-enabled cards.”(Business, 2017) The key to preventing an attack similar to this from occurring again is simply by educating the users. If the system implemented levels of authorization for different employees, the hacker would find it more difficult to access the network and employees would have restricted access to information available on the network. Lastly, Target could have “paid for licenses of fraud and malware protection software for endpoints” to prevent access to their portals. (Security Intelligence, 2017) Implementing strong security software and educating employees is essential in preventing cyber attacks from occurring in the future. \n\n\n\nWork Cited: \n\nMarks, Shayna.

A Logic bomb attack is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.\n\nThe background of this cyber-attack occurred because of a person who was working for a bank. The bank fired him and he wanted to get revenge on the bank using a logic bomb attack. He used malware which is capable of attacking a LNUX system remotely. On March 20, 14:00:01, the attack started to wipe the hard drives and master boot record on Microsoft Windows machines and then rebooted the system. During the logic bomb attack, over 48,000 computers were also affected and their hard drives were wiped. In addition, people could not use ATMs. This presentation will attract people who are working for network security. \n\nThe malware are usually planted user’s computers when people open and download a phishing email.

    "Q3": "Rachel Skidmore\n4/26/2017\nProfessor Everhart\nIS 300, Section 4\nUkraine Power Grid Attack\n\tWith new technology, comes new possible sources of attack on security. One specific cyber-attack was the Ukraine power grid attack which occurred on December 24, 2015. The Ukrainian electric system, specifically three of its energy distribution companies (called oblenergos) experienced coordinated cyber-attacks that were executed within 30 minutes of each other. After a power outage that lasted for several hours, the oblenergos were able to restore electrical service although the “impacted oblenergos continued to operate distribution systems in an operationally constrained mode” (Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center 2). \n\tThe Ukraine power grid attack is considered to be the first publicly acknowledged cyber-attack incident that resulted in power outages. The attackers who employed this wide-scale attack had a variety of skills to their name which included spear phishing emails, variants of the BlackEnergy 3 malware, and the manipulation of Microsoft Office documents that contained the malware to gain a foothold into the Information Technology (IT) networks of the electricity companies.” They showed expertise in operating ICSs through a supervisory control system as well as in network connected infrastructure. They also “demonstrated the capability and willingness to target field devices at substations, write custom malicious firmware, and render the devices, such as serial-to-ethernet converters, inoperable and uncoverable” (Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center 4=5).  \n\tDue to these cyber-attacks, 225,000 customers were affected in three different distribution territories. Their electricity was completely shut off and people couldn’t use their phones to call in to ask what was happening because phone lines were down as well. There aren’t exact measurements of how much money these attacks incurred but the scale of this attack was rated as high/critical by impacted companies possibly due to the reliability of their systems and business operations which were not up to par. Even months after these attacks, the systems that were hit were still acting constrained and not at full capacity.\n\tAs for what can be learned from this, there’s a couple different things. A form of spear phishing was used to begin the attack; employees who worked for the power grid companies that were affected received e-mails that held malicious links. Employees clicked on these links and malware was introduced to the system. Some ways to avoid this in the future is to “consider using sandboxing technology to evaluate documents and emails coming into the network, using proxy systems to control outbound and inbound communication paths, and limiting workstations to communicate only through the proxy devices by implementing perimeter egress access controls.” During the attack, attackers “used BlackEnergy 3 to establish a foothold and utilize keystroke loggers to perform credential theft.” A few ways to avoid credential theft is by monitoring all user account behavior, network and system communication and directory-level activity. Alarm capabilities could also be implemented to warn of risks detected within the system. These are just a few things the Ukrainian electrical companies could have done in order to disrupt the cyber-attacks before they could cause a power outage in the first place (Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center 14-15). \nCitations\nElectricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

    "Q3": "Home Depot's Data Breach\n\tIn today’s world, many companies are beginning to be under cyberattack.  Hackers are breaking into a company’s data and taking personal information.  Some are even taking customer information so that they can eventually hack the customers.  Hackers also break into a company’s data system and try to hack their sales device.  This type of attack happened to Home Depot in 2014.  \n\tIn 2014, Home Depot suffered a major data breach.  Hackers used a third-party’s login information to enter into Home Depot’s network (Smith, 2014).  Breaking into Home Depot’s network allowed the hackers to send malware into self-checkout devices throughout the United States and Canada.  Hackers were able to successfully complete this because they found a hole in the Microsoft Windows software that the self-checkouts units use.  They were then able to steal personal information, such as credit card numbers, from Home Depot’s customers.  Home Depot was able to see the breach because they noticed that malware had been deleted from a store computer.  \nAfter this breach, Home Depot had switched to Apple products, however, this did not completely fix the problem.  It took Home Depot five months to track the whole attack because the US Secret Service had notified the company of the attack.  This attack could have been stopped if their data security was high enough.  It is estimated that Home Depot had to pay at least $188 million per record in order to recover from the breach.  \n  \tIn conclusion, Home Depot suffered from a huge data breach because the Microsoft Windows software that they used in their self-checkout devices was not up to date.  The hackers sent malware into each device, causing many customers to suffer from credit card fraud, as well as, some other identity issues.  Home Depot had to spend a hefty check in order to recover from the breach.  This type of attack would not have even happened if Home Depot had bettered their data security.   \n\nCitation\nSmith, M.

    "Q3": "TARGET 2013 CYBER BREACH\n\n\nOn November 27, 2013 Target was a victim of a cyber-attack that affected “a range of 70 million to 110 million people”, which at the low end is about a third of American adults. Fraud experts have said that the information stolen from their systems has flooded the black market. “On Dec. 11, shortly after hackers first breached Target, Easy Solutions, a company that tracks fraud, noticed a 10 to twentyfold increase in the number of high-value stolen cards on black market websites, from nearly every bank and credit union.” Until this breach, the most extensive data breach on record for a retailer was “the theft of 90 million records from T. J. Maxx in 2005”.\n\n\n\tAttackers got into the corporate network through a compromised third party vendor. A phishing email managed to dupe one Fazio Mechanical employee, a refrigeration contractor. That email allowed Citadel, a variant of the Zeus banking Trojan, to be installed on Fazio Mechanical computers. Citadel in place, the attackers could take Fazio’s login credentials. According to unsubstantiated sources, “Fazio used the free version of Malwarebytes anti-malware, which offered no real-time protection being an on-demand scanner”. The hackers were then able to glean login credentials for the portals used by Fazio Mechanical, and then they figured out which portal “to subvert and use as a staging point into Target's internal network”. The attackers were then able to gain control of Target’s servers and found infected the internal Windows file server, which infected point of sale (POS) systems with malware. The POS malware “grabs credit/debit card information from the memory of POS-devices as cards are swiped”. The attackers were able to cover their tracks and sell the credit card data by moving the stolen data to off-site FTP servers and selling the data on the black market.\n\n\tThis attack cost Target “$148 million in the second quarter”, along with spending “tens of millions of dollars on breach-related costs since then”. According to John Kindervag, the vice president and principal analyst with Forrester Research, “I don’t see how they’re getting out of this for under a billion, over time,” he said, adding, “$150 million in a quarter seems almost like a bargain.”. “It’s going to take them a long time to build the trust of the shopper and get them to where they were prior to December 2013.”, Kindervag told the New York Times.\n\n\n\tAs a result of the breach, Target has tried to improve security, including: “Improved monitoring and logging of system activity, installed application whitelisting POS systems and implemented POS management tools, improved firewall rules and policies, limited or disabled vendor access to their network, disabled, reset, or reduced privileges on over 445,000 Target personnel and contractor accounts, expanded the use of two-factor authentication and password vaults, and trained individuals on password rotation”.\n\n\n\tData breaches that could compromise not only credit card data, but mailing lists, addresses, social security numbers, etc. will only continue to grow in size and number; Target is only one example of a growing epidemic, e.g. Home Depot, Sony PSN, eBay, etc. Until all industries make cybersecurity a priority, more people will be vulnerable to having their data stolen and sold.\n\n\n\nWORKS CITED:\n\nAbrams, R.

    "Q3": "Target Hack\n\n\nA couple days after thanksgiving in the year of 2013, someone installed malware into target’s security and payments system. The malware was designed to steal all credit cards used at the company. The hackers got the information by the customer swiping the card; the malware would then capture their credit card number and store on a target server made by them (Riley, 2014). Target has a team of security specialist that monitors computers 24 hours a day (Riley, 2014). If there were any activity going on a certain time, the security specialist would then contact the security operations center in Minneapolis. The company also said that they only went back and checked the systems were when the department of justice notified them, which was in mid-December (Riley, 2014)\n. \n\n\tOn November 30th the security specialist got a alert that malware was being uploaded to targets system all around the united states and they were trying to cover their tracks. The problem is when the security specialist contacted targets security operations center in Minneapolis, they failed to react to the alert. This is what caused 40 million credit card numbers, 70 million addresses phone numbers and other pieces of personal information (Riley, 2014). As a results target had to deal with 90 lawsuits filed against them, by banks and customers, On top of that they spent $61 million through February first responding to the breach (Riley, 2014). The biggest thing that affected them from the attack was targets profits during the holidays fell 46% compared to the year before (Riley, 2014). Target also failed to listen to their own system, fireeye, which alerted them November 30th and December 2nd of what was going on when the hackers installed another malware in the systems (Riley, 2014). Bloomberg states that the alerts went off early enough; the hackers didn’t even start transmitting the credit card data yet (Riley, 2014). Target came out and said that they would spend $100 million for registers and other technology that read cards that have chips embedded into them (Riley, 2014) The reason for these embedded chips is because it makes everything more secure. \n\nThe hackers got into an HVAC vendor to get into targets network (Riley, 2014). Then they put the malware into the cashier stations. On December 2nd the hackers were getting the credit card information. They then installed a code that sent the card information to a staging point (Riley, 2014).  On December 12th the federal government warned target of the breach. Then on December 15ht target confirmed that there was a breach of their system.\nThe systems worked by creating a parallel computer network on virtual machines. The hacker’s tools then fooled targets fireeye technology into thinking they were real computers (Riley, 2014).  Then the deployed their custom-made code. The system fireye also had a option where it can automatically delete malware as it’s detected (Riley, 2014). Unfortunately target’s security team had that feature turned off. As a result it made it very easy for the hackers to have enough time to retrieve enough information.\nIn conclusion this whole target could have prevented if the security specialist that target had hired were actually doing their job and paying attention. Even though millions of hacks happen daily, we have the resources to stop them before the real threat begins. Yet people still continue to ignore the alerts and wait last minute before taking action. Target can’t blame anyone but themselves for the millions of dollars spent fixing the issue and the amount of lawsuits that they got. I hope more and more companies learn from a company like target, and train their security employees, do stress test, and provide the right tools to stop attacks like these. This will not only keep the company safe from breaches but also the millions of families that could possibly be affected by an attack.\n\nRiley, M., Elgin, B., Lawrence, D., Matlack, C.

    "Q3": "The case study that I decided to research was the 2013 Logic Bomb attack in South Korea. According to the article Logic Bomb Set Off South Korea Cyberattack; it states, \"A cyberattack that wiped the hard drives of computers belonging to banks and broadcasting companies in South Korea this week was set off by a logic bomb in the code, according to a security firm in the U.S.\"(Zetter 1).\n\nSome background information regarding the attack was that \"The logic bomb dictated the date and time the malware would begin erasing data from machines to coordinate the destruction across multiple victims\"(Zetter 1). This attack was known because of the severity of the attack. As it stated, \"The attack, which struck machines on March 20, wiped the hard drives and master boot record of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously\"(Zetter 1).\n\nThe damages were a lot since three banks of South Korea were attacked, according to another article I found called 'Logic Bomb' dropped a brokerage, it mentions the totl cost of damage from that cyber attack. As it states, \"logic bomb\" program that caused more than $3 million in damage to the brokerage's computer network\"(Collins 1).\n\nThis type of article targets people who don't have much knowledge about cyber attacks and how much of a loss it is when a cyber attack occurs. A resolution of this would be that if there was a backup of all that personal bank information then the banks won't be at a huge loss because the back up was stored somewhere safely.\n\nOne major lesson learned from this is to have good cyber security for banks and other companies because you never know you can become a victim of a cyber attack. A major lesson would be to spend money on cyber security so situations like the 2013 Logic Bomb in South Korea doesn't occur or at least the risks are greatly minimized.\n\nZetter, K.

Criminals are using Olympic Vision to invade company computers and return screen shots and Key-log data through things like email or web based means. Criminals then use the information gathered to steal things such as: credentials, passwords, product keys, images, and text. (Carlos & Salvador, 2017)\n\n\tInformation that key loggers steal can be used to steal cash, gain inside knowledge on a company, or even blackmail members of a company.  When key loggers gain product keys and network keys, criminals can hold companies ransom or even shut down some day-to-day operations costing the company money. The FBI has estimated the damages in 2015-2016 to be a total of $800 million. (Carlos & Salvador, 2017)\n\n\tThe Olympic Vision malware automatically downloads onto a computer once an employee opens an infected email and clicks on a link. The code that downloads also disables some tools and functions of the computer such as the Task Manager to avoid detection. The malware also disguises itself as other software on the system. (Carlos & Salvador, 2017)\n\n\tCompanies should educate their employees often about the dangers of clicking on links on the web. Once computers are infected it can be difficult to detect, and by the time the malware is detected it can be too late. Examples of emails should be used to show how authentic an email can look.

When Target decided to send a statement to the public, all major credit and debit card companies started to watch their customer’s data streams and withdrawal amounts. After government officials got involved they found a Russian malware called Kaptoxa, this attack was not left at Target but at other retailers as well. Target provided affected customers a free service to watch their financial activities and a hotline to call if they were a victim of the attack. Some lessons learned are to communicate to the affected public immediately, invest in prevention, and invest in some of the latest security (Burg, 2014). Communication to all related entities is important for cases like this because the damage could be mitigated or lessened to a similar degree, in this case, Target was slow to respond to the hack and slow to tell the millions of customers that continued to shop at their stores. Investing in prevention and the latest security is important as it will give the company substantial more time to reach out for assistance from different emergency services to protect their customers’ data. \n\nWorks Cited\nBurg, N.

A data breach is \"an incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data has potentially been viewed, stolen or used by an unauthorized to do so.\"(Rouse, n.d). It is most common when dealing with corporate network as in this case, Target is used as an example. The hackers that were a part of this data breach stole personal information from customers that purchased items from Target between November 27 and December 15, 2013. So many people were affected by this data breach because it was during the time of Black Friday. According to this article, the information that was stolen from these customers were credit and debit card numbers, the card's expiration date, and CVV. \n     During this data breach, the company originally estimated that 40 million customers were hit. Due to further investigation, it has been confirmed that \"an additional 70 million people were affected, and the stolen customer information includes names, mailing address, phone numbers and email addresses\". (McGrath, 2014). Another damage to the company is that it lowered the fourth quarter 2013 earnings guidance. This means that the expected sales decrease. The targeted audience for this article would be anyone who shops or preciously shopped at Target or any other retail stores for that matter, where this incident can happen once again.\n     Due to the incident that has happened, the company has decided to provide its customers with one year of free credit monitoring as well as identity theft protection. This is to make sure they don't face any law major law suits, if any. This will also ensure the safety of customer's information in hope that they will be less worrisome. After reading this article, it is more in my conscious to be careful when doing major holiday shopping where these data breaches can happen again. One way to avoid this situation from happening again would be to pay with cash. That way, there is no way or capturing any of my bank information or any other personal information unless the individual gives it out themselves. \n\n\nCitations: \n\nMcGrath, M. (2014, January 10).

The hack affected everyone who shopped at Target November 27th- December 15th. These dates included black Friday weekend. In article 2, it states that security experts believe the hackers had access to the terminals where customers swiped their credit cards, or tracked and collected data as it moved from Target to credit card processors. Many questions remain unanswered, but Gregg Steinhafel, the chairman of Target, spoke out: “I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this.” According to article 2, estimated damages included forty-million people with their debit or credit card accounts hacked, and in addition, around seventy million people with personal identity theft (emails, phone numbers, etc). A concern that was raised was that hackers could use the stolen data to make credit card replicas. \n\tIn article 1, it explains that Target’s resolution to this hack was to offer affected customers a free credit-monitoring service. They also set up a telephone hotline where customers could call with concerns and questions. Additionally, Target offered a 10% store-wide discount over the weekend. \n\tA lesson learned from this large-scale hack was that security needed to be improved. The hack was performed on such a large-scale because the main Target store headquarters was targeted, where all of the information runs through and is processed.

    "Q3": "There are many different types of cyber attacks that people use. One such attack was knows as the Mirai Botnet. A botnet is basically a network of infected computers that can be controlled remotely. The Mirai Botnet is significant because “it managed to make much of the internet unavailable to millions of people” (Newman) for the company Dyn. The Mirai is a infection that “automatically finds Internet of Things devices” (Newman) which are created into botnets. Mirai has interrupted other companies like Deutsche Telekom in Germany which disrupted internet service for over 900,000 people. Due to the fact that Mirai botnet code is easily changeable, many hackers can create there own variant of the Mirai. Due to the fact that Mirai is easily adaptable, almost any hacker can use it. Cyber security is something that needs to be taken with great importance. For example, the Mirai Botnet in 2016 created one of the largest DdoS attacks. Over 150,000 devices were compromised as a result of that attack. It is important to stay commited to security practices so that botnets and other attacks can not harm us. Consumers of large companies or sites are often the targets of Mirai botnet attacks. One way to prevent this from happening is for companies to hire cyber security experts to solve any problems that the company or site faces. Looking back at Dyn, we can see that they should have invested more resources into their Cyber security programs. This could have prevented a Mirai botnet attack. They need to do a better job at promoting awareness on cyber attacks and the different types of attacks. This will keep our networks and internet safe from viruses and attacks.\n\n\n\n\nNewman, Lily.

    "Q3": "The Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, was the victim of an SQL Injection attack sometime between 2015 and 2016. An SQL Injection attack is a type of cyberattack that occurs whenever a hacker exploits a vulnerability in a website and manages to insert a malicious piece of code into a webpage input section (Morgenroth, 2017, p. 1). It is common for this webpage input section to be the location where users input their username and password to gain access to their accounts. The malicious piece of code allows the hacker to gain access to and make changes to the command statements for the program. The hacker sends a command to retrieve details about the database in the SQL programming language. The database incorrectly believes that the hacker is supposed to have access to its secrets and allows him/her to bypass the system’s security measures. This results in the database telling the hacker about everything that he/she wants to know about the contents of the database.\n\tWith regards to the Mossack Fonseca SQL Injection attack, the webpage input section that was manipulated was the login to the website’s payment system (Paganini, 2016, p. 1). Hackers gained access to the payment system because the directory of the database was not properly locked after a recent update. Additionally, the WordPress Revolution Slider plug-in was outdated. Thus, it did not have any of the most recent patches that would have protected the website against the known exploits that the hackers used to “violate… [the company’s] email servers” during the attack (Paganini, 2016, p. 1). Once hackers got access to WordPress, they found the database’s credentials which would eventually serve as their master key. The database’s credentials were tied to the email server; by obtaining these credentials, hackers gained control of the entire website. This is how they viewed every email that had ever been sent by the website’s users since the creation of the website. \n\tWhen the information that was gained during the attack was leaked in early 2016, the estimated damages were numerous. Over 11 million documents were seized; this equates to over 2.6 Terabytes of data (Paganini, 2016, p. 1). The targeted audience of the attack was corrupt government officials that were suspected of money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion. Based on the targeted audience of the attack, it is evident that the hackers were politically motivated. In fact, the information that was leaked from the hack directly helped to change the tide of the 2016 United States Presidential Election. It reinforced then-presidential candidate Donald Trump’s claim that many U.S. and foreign government leaders as well as Clinton campaign operatives and donors were extremely corrupt and had been taking part in unethical business dealings for a long duration of time (Markay, 2016, p. 1).  \n\tSince the cyberattack occurred, Mossack Fonseca has upgraded its website’s security capabilities and is attempting to restore its brand integrity. This SQL Injection attack’s heavy impact on one of the most uncertain elections in American history indicates the importance of regular security maintenance and the heavy cost that results from failing to verify that controls are properly in place after a partial or full system update.  \n\n\nBibliography: \n\nMarkay, L.

    "Q3": "Ukraine Power Grid Attack\n\tOn December 23rd, 2016, the Ukraine power grid underwent an attack that lead to over 225,000 individuals being without electricity. The attack was very well synchronized, had multiple stages, and ultimately changed the way entire nations look at their power grids.\n\tThe hackers who planned the attack were skilled and stealthy strategist who carefully planned their attack over the course of many months. They used reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials, then launched as a synchronized attack. Workers logging remotely into the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) network that controlled the grid, weren’t required to use two-factor authentication to gain access to the network. This lack of authentication lead to attackers hijacking credentials and gaining access to crucial parts of the system that controls the breaks.\n\tThe hackers struck multiple power distribution centers leaving more 230,000 residents without power for about 6 hours. In addition to that the hackers also disabled backup power supplies to two of the three distribution centers, leaving operators stumbling in the dark. “As the attackers opened up breakers and took a string of substations off the grid, they also overwrote the firmware on some of the substation serial-to-Ethernet converters, replacing legitimate firmware with their malicious firmware and rendering the converters thereafter inoperable and unrecoverable, unable to receive commands.” (Zeter, 2016). Plant members were able to recover so quickly after the shutdown because their system controls at a distribution level is not that automated. The automated parts of their system that did occur was taken over 100% by the hackers. \n        Although the distribution center was able to take back control of the plants, months after regaining access to the distribution centers, U.S. investigators still see the hostile effects of the firmware changes. According to US Computer security experts “Attackers overwrote firmware on critical devices at 16 of the substations, leaving them unresponsive to any remote commands from operators. The power is on, but workers still have to control the breakers manually.” This lasting effect teaches global power grid companies who have mostly automated systems to secure a manual backup functionality in the event that attacks attempt to sabotage their automated systems. With everything being so automated now it could have been much harder for organizations to restore power.\n       The Ukraine power grid attack was very well synchronized, had multiple stages, and ultimately forced companies to increase security measures. One of the ways organizations can begin to protect employee credentials is by implementing two factor authentications to verify employees are logging on at any given time. This power grid attack can be used as somewhat of a nationwide wake up call for organizations to protect themselves. \n\n\n\nWORK CITED:\nZeter, Kim (2016, March 03).

    "Q3": "OPM Breach\nDuring the late months of 2013 throughout mid-2015, the Office of Personal Management (OPM) was the victim of a cyberattack.  During the beginning of this timeline, OPM was oblivious to what was happening. Thousands of hackers attempt to breach the United States government, however with the firewalls and encryptions used to store data none are very successful at gaining sensitive information.  The hacking group responsible is believed to be a highly sophisticated group in China whom are known for leaving comic book names in there digital trail.  This infamous hacking group was targeting the information of government employees more specifically those of which that worked for OPM. This hacktivist group used spear phishing to launch their attack on OPM. Spear phishing is when a hacker targets an organization or company with a tailored emailed which has malware in the emails attachments. \n\tDuring 2013 many of the networks used in the government where out of date and had low security measures. For example many employees had simple passwords, which did not change periodically. For this reason it is believed that the Chinese hacking group sent a phishing attack to a contracted government company of OPM and then used their credentials, username and password, to access OPM’s networks. Once the hackers got into the network they then installed malware on key computers on the network, which were vital to transmitting data and information throughout the system. The malware installed on the computer then rerouted the employees to a fake government website which prompted the user to input their login information. Once that information was obtained the hackers now had access to information from Full names to fingerprints. This affected not only government employees, but also their families and people who had applied for government positions. In total an estimation of more than 20 million people were affected by this breach. \n\tThere have been mixed results with the use of the stolen information. Some of the affected employees claim that they have never seen any tampering with their personal accounts.  While others say they constantly are explaining to their banks why there is a 10,000 purchase at best buy, which was not them. Since the breach, OPM has been working with key government security agencies to ensure this does not happen again. Many if not all government agencies now require 2 factor identification to log in to their networks, a password and username and as well as a piv card, which serves as an identification card recognized by the network. The Government has also given everyone affected by the breach 3 years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.\n\tAfter a tremendous amount of loss, from the OPM breach, the government and its departments have been improving their information systems. To help prevent the loss of information contractors and other government related employees are only given access to information which is critical to them. If the contractors at OPM at the time had not been given unnecessary access to the government network, the breach may never had happened. With the information systems updated, and networks being properly monitored. The United States government is taking all of the necessary actions they deem appropriate to decrease the likelihood of another breach.\n\nWorks Cited\nNaylor, Brain.
